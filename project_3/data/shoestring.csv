,Shoestring,"Hello friends, 

I want to spend 6 months next year from March until September travelling across Europe. The only issue is I don’t have much saved up. I’ll be travelling on an Irish passport so visas shouldn’t be an issue in EU countries. 

I was considering working on the super yachts, but because I have no experience, need to be back at University in Sept and also have two weeks off in June for a family event  - I don’t think that will work. 

I have heard that working in hostels is a good way to do this. I want to see as much as possible, spending maximum a month in each country.

I have a hobby of aviation and finding cheap airfare. I thought rather than just looking at random flights I could do something fun and pay something forward.

Give me your flights in something like this format the more specific the better. Please COPY and EDIT the below format :)

\* Origin: ex. NYC (JFK, EWR, LGA)

\* DEST: ex. Miami/FLL

\* Departure Dates: ex. 7/1 or 7/1-&gt;7/20

\* Return Dates: ex. 7/1 or 7/1-&gt;7/20. IF One-way just say NA

\* LENGTH: ex. 4 days (If you say 1 week please say 7 days or 7-8 days ect.)

\* Other: ex No Layovers over 4 hours.

\* Expected Budget: \~$120 (optional, Just want to see if I can get below this goal)

\* Bags: Carry-On (Goes in the overhead bin)? Personal Item (fits under the seat in front of you)? Checked Bag? This actually matters in the difference in price alot. EX. 1 carry-on, no checked bags.

Again, PLEASE be as specific and as unambiguous as possible. ie 7/15-&gt;7/30  or +/- 1 day is better than ""Late July"" or ""flexible"".

Also, I did not get to everyone last time, so feel free to repost requests.

I know probably it ain't much, but I'm a student and for me it's pretty high.

[More Swiss resources]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/85jbdn/resources_for_switzerland/).

---

**---General Points---**

**Switzerland is expensive to visit**

Switzerland is well known for being expensive in comparison with surrounding countries (and most other countries in the world). Even a basic McDonalds meal will be painfully expensive to most visitors. If you are careful then a fun (if basic) trip can be had for less than 70CHF a day, or with eating out and spending on activities for more like 150CHf per day. If you are really hardcore and wild camp and eat what is basic enough to stay alive then 10CHF might be possible.

Living and working here you do at least have much higher pay than elsewhere and so very strong buying power. As someone living and working in Switzerland I mostly do daytrips or just for 1-2 nights at weekends, and so am lucky as most of the concerns of costs are covered by the salary and not being far from home. I do try and keep costs down so I have learnt quite a bit myself in how to avoid painful prices. 


**Ultimately if you really are on a tight budget and want to see the Alps then France, Austria, Germany, and Slovenia are all cheaper and offer much of the same.** 

As with Swiss watches the appeal is partly in the historical branding and the popular mindset, rather than Switzerland being the be-all-and-end-all of the topic.

**Not everything is that expensive**

The basics for travel are expensive (food/accommodation/transport) but many activities are actually cheaper than elsewhere. Compared to say London where many attractions are £20+ ($26 USD) or even the insane 200 KN ($31 USD) to walk the walls in Dubrovnik many Swiss attractions are quite reasonable. 

* Entry to the Château de Chillon is 13.5 CHF ($15 USD); less than half the price of the Tower of London and cheaper than most other castles in the UK.  

* A return ticket on my local cable car to a high ridge with panoramic views of the Alps and into French and Germany costs less than the half hour spin on the London Eye.

**If you google around there are plenty of sites and blogs with suggestions in general, or for specific places**

* The [official tourist website]( https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-gb/affordable-switzerland.html) has a dedicated section.

* The [English Swiss forum]( https://www.englishforum.ch/travel-day-trips-free-time/2028-days-out-good-deals-free-switzerland.html) has plenty of threads. 

* Lost in Switzerland has some interesting ideas like [this]( https://lostinswitzerland.com/save-money/) and [this]( https://lostinswitzerland.com/meet-the-bloggers/). 

* For specific locations [Tripsavvy have a good page on Geneva](https://www.tripsavvy.com/geneva-on-a-budget-1508340) and [Greyworldnomads have a good page on Zürich](https://www.greyworldnomads.com/zurich-on-a-budget/).

* Though if you spend much time searching through the rest of the results you will find that most pages just offer the same few fairly obvious bits of advice (go to the supermarket etc).

**Be sure to double check the official details of anything I list on here**

Things change with time and due to the size and scope of this post I am not going in depth with all the details – be sure to read up on the terms and conditions of any pass or other offers rather than just what is on here.

**Be wary of advice from randoms online.**

I have seen people complain about absurd prices (that a small lunch cost them 45CHF, or a simple takeaway sandwich cost them 20CHF) that simply are insane and exceptions rather than the rule (if they were even real to start with). 

Likewise context is important: I have seen visitors from various parts of the USA claim Swiss food prices in the shops are cheaper, comparable, and far more expensive than back home (which may well all have been true).

---

**----Accommodation-----**


In general:

* Official accommodation (which should include Airbnb) will give you a guest card in many cities and tourist focused areas. The exact benefits vary but normally include free local transport and free/discounted activities. Sometimes cable car rides will be included for free too. Usually you can look up what is included online beforehand ([eg: for the Jungfrau region]( https://jungfrauregion.swiss/en/summer/services/guestcard/)). You get the guest card at check in and it is valid until the end of the day that you check out on, sometimes you can print your accommodation reservation and use that to travel for free on the day of arrival before you check in too (again check the local website to see if that is valid). Mostly you only get the benefits in the town/village and places 10-20 minutes away, [but in the beautiful and underrated canton of Ticino it covers the entire canton]( https://www.ticino.ch/en/ticket.html) which is an incredible deal (if you are day tripping out of a main base then you can easily save more on transport than you spend on accommodation, especially as campsites are valid accommodation). 

* The most important factor here is season; January/February will be high season for skiing in the mountains (with December/March as the shoulder season), July/August will be high season for summer everywhere (with June/September as the shoulder season), and in most areas April/May and October/November are off season. So if you go to the Alps in May or October it will be much easier to find cheap accommodation than in August or February. The flip side is that not everything will be open or doable in the shoulder or off seasons (but it can still be worth visiting if you just want to enjoy the landscape but don’t have a certain hike or peak you are dead set on doing). For cities like Lugano that are more focused on summer tourism and don’t have a local ski resort  then it will be much cheaper in the winter months like February than during the summer.

* It *might* help to look to lesser known areas. You might be able reduce accommodation costs by staying somewhere nice but unknown. The difference probably won’t be significant, but if for example you stay in Täsch rather than the more famous and popular neighbouring Zermatt you will likely find more budget options.

* Sticking to one area for longer will help cut transport costs down. Jumping several hours by train everyday will get expensive fast without a general pass.

* If breakfast isn’t included and is more than 10CHF, then unless you are a heavy morning eater you might better off popping to a café or bakery for a coffee and bite to eat instead.

* Tourist tax might not be included in the listed price (typically 2-3CHF per person per night). Likewise check for a non-listed cleaning fee if it is an apartment or Airbnb, this might not be too bad if it is after a week but could be a very nasty add-on for just a night or two.

Where to look:

* Aside from the standard options like Booking and Airbnb for finding rooms you might also want to look into https://alp.holidaybooking.ch/?language=en, and https://www.rooms.ch/ , and https://bnb.ch/ , and https://www.bauernhof-ferien.ch/ , and https://www.myfarm.ch/en/accommodation especially their [sleep in straw]( https://www.myfarm.ch/en/sleep-on-straw#dontPreselectRegion=true&amp;resultsPerPage=&amp;tagIds=-4912901150941820) options which can be as low as 30CHF with breakfast included, and https://naturfreunde.ch/haeuser/ .

* [Swiss Hotel Card]( https://hotelcard.com/en?change_locale=en) requires a paid membership (99CHF per year) but gives you 50% off bookings at participating hotels in Switzerland, Austria, Germany, and Italy. In many Swiss hotels this would pay for itself after 2 nights (or just 1). It does seem to be focused on helping hotels during the off-season so the website states that only “75% of the time” is open (but that is still good for domestic tourists). I have not used this myself yet.

* [Couchsurfing]( https://www.couchsurfing.com/) is free, but that is more about being a part of something rather than just a cheap place to crash. 

Hostels:

* Hostels can be had for as low as 20CHF for a bunk in a shared room if you are going to a popular tourist-heavy location like Interlaken or Luzern. But they are not always that cheap (especially in a ski resort in winter when a dorm bed can set you back 50CHF or more). Or even the cheapest option: a private room for 2 people in a budget hotel can be cheaper than 2 beds in a dorm. Check https://www.hostelz.com/ in addition to Hostelworld.

* [YHA hostels](https://www.youthhostel.ch/en/) whilst not the cheapest are a good budget option that can be found all over the country, they tend to be family/relaxed places rather than party hostels. They are always clean, come with a good breakfast and some like Grindelwald have unbeatable views. The buildings tend to be very nice (in some cases like Burgdorf they are renovated castles). Sadly most don’t have a guest kitchen or fridge (check the info page for each location), but do offer cheap starter/main/dessert dinners for 18CHF. If you are looking at the YHAs then book on their website rather than Hostelworld etc to avoid paying the extra for not being a member (membership pays for itself after only a few nights so it is worth signing up).

Camping:

* Camping. Standard campsites: www.tcs.ch , www.camping.ch , and www.sccv.ch. In addition there are a few websites where you can officially find a small patch to pitch up on a farm: https://www.nomady.ch/ , and [myfarm.ch](https://www.myfarm.ch/de/campingplatz-zeltplatz#dontPreselectRegion=true&amp;resultsPerPage=&amp;tagIds=-3360035520941820).

* Wild camping is complex. The best way to sum it up is ""Prohibited but tolerated under conditions"". [This SAC page has the most official guidelines]( https://www.sac-cas.ch/de/umwelt/bergsport-und-umwelt/campieren-und-biwakieren/). There are some rough rules of thumb for the ideal situation: above the tree line, with the community / landowner’s permission, [not in a protected area]( https://map.geo.admin.ch/?lang=de&amp;layers=ch.bafu.wrz-wildruhezonen_portal,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-auen,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-hochmoore,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-flachmoore_regional,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-flachmoore,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-jagdbanngebiete,ch.bafu.schutzgebiete-schweizerischer_nationalpark,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-trockenwiesen_trockenweiden&amp;layers_opacity=0.9,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.75&amp;bgLayer=ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-farbe&amp;zoom=0&amp;topic=ech&amp;E=2643780.17&amp;N=1164842.39), single tent, set up as the sun goes down and dismantle at dawn, no fire/noise/disturbance/litter. Wild camping has increased in popularity in recent years, [iconic spots like Seealpsee are having problems with numbers](https://www.fm1today.ch/ostschweiz/appenzellerland/zu-viele-wildcamper-am-seealpsee-135572094), so try and pick a less known spot.

---

 **----Transport-----**

This is always a hard question to answer. The best solution will change depending on time-frame, number of people, how much you want to see/do across the country, and how much you want to keep your options open. **Ultimately you will have to make a rough plan and calculate which option provides the best value.**

Public transport will get you just about anywhere you need to go and many train lines have views you won't get from the roads. For public transport there are number of train passes to cover full or partial cost, the whole country or just an area, that can be bought anytime at a set price or are limited and vary in price. It can be somewhat overwhelming. [I have written quite extensively about this, especially public transport, in a previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/8th1oc/my_guide_to_transport_in_switzerland/) and there are various other guides online to help there ([for example this]( https://lostinswitzerland.com/public-transport-101/)).

A few important examples:

* Booking individual tickets in advance in itself does not make any difference to the price (unlike various other places in Europe like the UK and Germany). However from 60 days before the day of travel you can buy [“Supersaver“ tickets](https://www.sbb.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets/tickets-for-switzerland/supersaver-tickets.html) which reduce the cost by up to 70%, but are only available at off-peak times and lock you to a certain train. This can be combined with the half-fare card for further discounts. A set number of supersaver tickets are available, so depending on how in demand a certain train is they might be sold out weeks in advance or be available still just before departure.

* The [Swiss Travel Pass]( https://www.sbb.ch/en/leisure-holidays/travel-in-switzerland/international-guests/swiss-travel-pass.html) might seem horrifically expensive at first glance, but if you are wanting to travel far and wide from a single base it will very quickly pay for itself. In addition to standard transport it also covers most ships, a number of cable cars (even going up to Rigi Kulm and Schilthorn for no extra cost), discounts on most of the rest of the mountain transport, and free entry to most museums. 

* [Children get free or discounted travel.]( https://www.sbb.ch/en/timetable/travel-advice/children.html#:~:text=Children%20under%20six%20years%20of,travel%20with%20them%20for%20free.) Below the age of 6 children can travel free of charge if they are accompanied by somebody 12 over older who has a ticket. The [Junior Swiss Travel card]( https://www.sbb.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets/railpasses/junior-travelcard-children-co-travelcard.html) costs 30CHF for a year and lets a child aged 6-16 travel for free so long as they travel with a parent. The pass is even free from the 3rd child.

* If you want to be very flexible then [Fairtiq](https://fairtiq.com/en-ch/) might be worth checking out so you can hop on and off, or change direction without worrying about buying a ticket at the start.

Driving might be cheaper, especially with a group of people. However keep in mind:

* If you are renting then it *might* be cheaper to rent just across the border in a neighbouring country and drive in.

* If you are driving in from another country you will need to buy a 40CHF annual vignette to use the motorways (but not the smaller streets). This is actually really good value if you live here, less so if you want to just drive for a few hours to cut across the country.

* Parking can be very expensive.

* Some popular tourist spots like Zermatt/Wengen/Mürren are car-free so you have to pay for parking and then the transport to get you the last 10 minutes to the place.

* Traffic offenses (speeding, not having your headlights on at all times) will result in VERY large fines.

Also:

* If you are flying into Geneva and going to the city then you can get [a ticket for free transport into the city from the luggage retrieval area](http://www.geneva.info/transport/free-ticket/).

* You might also look into ride sharing like BlaClaCar. I have not used this, but from what I have read you should be prepared for cancelations and to be flexible.

* Hitchhiking is possible and probably as safe as it is going to get, but I have no experience there.

---

**----Food----**

Do it yourself:

* You almost never need to buy water. Tap water is fine, and just about every fountain has drinkable water (unless there is a sign on it stating otherwise). When in the mountains you can fill up from streams assuming there isn’t a farm or animals grazing above you.

* Supermarket food is the obvious go to. But compared to the neighbouring countries you are still paying 50% or more for food items.  Migros is the cheaper Swiss supermarket that you will find everywhere and is good quality. Denner is the slightly cheaper sister of Migros which isn’t always as easy to find. Lidl and Aldi are cheaper still, however they tend not to be in central areas or smaller towns or villages. Most supermarkets will have a small reduced section for goods near the sell by date. Be aware that supermarkets close early (typically 7pm or earlier), and outside of tourist resorts will be closed on a Sunday. There will be a shop (or a whole shopping complex) open everyday until 10pm at train or petrol stations though – but these are often more expensive.

* If you REALLY love bread/cheese/pasta you can feed yourself for 10CHF for the whole day (maybe get an apple too to keep the scurvy at bay).

* Markets on Wednesday/Saturday mornings are typically much more expensive than supermarkets. A few stands might offer free samples, but no market is big enough that you are going to fill up on them.

* Places showing off a certain product (dairy, chocolate factory, etc) might give away a few free samples or include them in the tour price. The Kambly Erlebnis where you can eat as much as you want of their entire range without any need to buy anything is probably the best example of this, but it is rather out of the way for most trips. Whether you will save anything by going to such places compared to supermarket prices or are still able to buy cheap bags of rejects seems to be questionable.

* A restaurant Fondue will set you back 25CHF per person or more. [But a much cheaper and equally Swiss option is to buy some Cervelat sausages from any supermarket and go roast them over a fire somewhere in the countryside]( https://www.swiss-meat.com/filemount/_processed_/csm_Cervelat_grilliert_933x622_f3e01dac82.jpg).

* The cheapest beer is the supermarket own brands like the COOP “Prix Garantie Lager” which cost 0.5CHF per 0.5L can. Apparently these are mostly very acceptable for the price. 

* Meat is really expensive. Avoiding it will help cut costs.

* You can bring food in with you, or if you have time then leave the country to go shopping (it is what the Swiss who live near the borders do). [However Switzerland is not in the EU custom zone and there are limits on how much you can bring in per person without paying customs tax]( https://www.ezv.admin.ch/ezv/en/home/information-individuals/travel-and-purchases--allowances-and-duty-free-limit/importation-into-switzerland/duty-free-allowances--foodstuffs--alcohol-and-tobacco.html). It is not certain you will be checked at the border, but it isn’t impossible (especially on a Saturday afternoon when many Swiss shoppers will be coming back over the border).

Eating out:

* There are plenty of takeaway options at stations and in larger towns. Figure 4-8CHF for a Sandwich/baguette or 8-10CHF for a kebab. Many cheap food stands might close by 7pm, or earlier if they are just aimed to commuters/shoppers, but there should always be something open to 10pm in any decent sized town.

* There are a chain of cafes/outlets that sell day-old bread and baked goods sourced from local bakeries at a reduced price – [ÄSS-BAR](http://www.aess-bar.ch/) (meaning edible). These are only in the bigger cities at the moment, but have central locations.

* Apps like “Too good to go” or “Homemade” are an option for finding cheap food (though outside of the bigger cities you might have very limited or no options). 

* Some areas have special deal packages you can buy, like [“Zwei Für Eins”]( https://www.zweifuereins.ch/) (two for one). However that is better suited to residents rather than short term visitors.

* Migros restaurants are a budget friendly favourite. You can easily get a good meal for 15CHF (typically lunch as they are closed later in the evenings and all day on Sundays). The restaurants in the Manor department stores are also well regarded, some have quite nice views too.

* Restaurants do not have to be as expensive as some people make out. You can easily find a Rösti or pizza for about 15CHF. A good dinner with drinks for 2 people for less than 50CHF should be easy to come across. Another option is to look for fixed menus at lunch time which will offer a good meal for 15-20CHF (especially at Italian or Asian places).

* Finding coffee for less then 5CHF (and not a big one at that) will be very hard. My record is 3.5 CHF in Vallorbe.

* You don’t want to know what a cocktail at a fancy club is going to cost you.

---

**----Activities----**

Obviously do something weather suitable. Money for a cable car ride is better spent on a sunny day than a wet and foggy one.

* Take advantage of the free information. The quality of information you get through the [Swiss topographic maps]( https://map.geo.admin.ch/) (see the Swisstopo phone app for one the go) is very useful for planning trips. It is very detailed, quick to load and allow all kinds of layers like hiking routes to be added is incredible and way beyond anything I have seen elsewhere – and all for free. Likewise the [MeteoSwiss website]( https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/) (and app) offer lots of information and various maps to help plan your days. Being a popular destination for 200+ years means that there are endless sources for reading up on ideas.

* Just walking around and taking things in is an obvious choice: most sights in towns like the churches, walls, and old towns are free to explore. All the main sights in Luzern (Lucerne) are free and easy to see by foot [(see the tour suggestion in this post)]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/afin8w/my_guide_to_luzern_lucerne_switzerland/). 

* Free walking tours exist in most cities. In Bern you can even book a free tour around the Parliament building.

* [You can use the list at the bottom of this article to see free museums (click to arrange by *Eintritt*)]( https://blog.tagesanzeiger.ch/datenblog/index.php/865/schweizer-museen-im-check), others are free on certain days like a certain Sunday of month, otherwise 10-12CHF is a fairly standard price. If you plan to visit lots of museums then [the Museum Pass]( https://www.museumspass.ch/en/where-to-use-my-museum-pass/) might be worth a look – the Museum Pass is included in the Swiss Travel Pass.

* If you travel by public transport you can get [special Leisure deals with SBB that reduce the cost of some activities]( https://www.sbb.ch/en/leisure-holidays.html). For example in summer 2020 there is an offer for the FIFA World Football Museum that gives you 20% reduction on the journey to the location and back, and 20% reduction on admission to the Museum.

* Larger and/or more popular places will have more extensive listings for free and budget events. For example [Zürich on a Budget]( https://www.zuerich.com/en/visit/things-to-do-for-free) and [Zürich unbezahlbar]( https://www.zuerichunbezahlbar.ch/events/) for Zürich.

* In Bern you can see the bears for free and various other places have free wildlife parks (typically the free or cheaper ones will focus on local animals such as [Wildnispark Zürich Langenberg]( https://www.wildnispark.ch/) or [Biel Tierpark]( https://tierpark-biel.ch/)).

* Festivals like Swiss National Day (August 1st) and Fasnacht (February time) provide free entertainment through fireworks, parades, and various other kinds of craziness. These range from Christmas markets to the burning of explosive wooden effigies [(I have a list of more unique Swiss events here)]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/8qkvjl/my_list_of_the_most_interestinguniquemad/).

Shopping:

* Manor/ COOP often sell the standard souvenirs and chocolates that you find in tourist shops but might well be cheaper.

Hiking, cable cars, and enjoying the views in general:

* The views are free. But getting to them can be expensive, or otherwise require quite a bit of effort. The fitter you are the more you can do without having to take a cable car.

* Resorts give you information about what is open/closed, what there is to do, and usually have multiple webcams showing the conditions at various locations. There is no excuse for paying a wodge of cash to find that all you can do is walk around a small viewing platform and see the same rain that you were already in below.

* If you have the Swiss Travel Pass you get a free ride on most boats, or up a number of cable cars and some mountain trains. Typically to those where there is a village, but it even goes to Schilthorn and the top of Rigi. If you don’t get a free ride then you should get a 50% discount off the ticket.

* Check ahead on the website for a cable car if you are hoping to get a discount with your Swiss Pass or half fare card. It works almost everywhere, but some resort areas (eg Davos) only give a discount if you are staying there and have a guest card.


* Sometimes you will get an early bird / good morning ticket discount on cable cars or other mountain transport. Jungfraujoch for example has discounted Good Morning and Good Afternoon tickets if you are only up early or late, and Niederhorn gives you a free return if you go up before 9am.


* The unsung Postbus is very cheap for what they offer. They will not get you to mountain peaks, but you can get higher up valleys or passes, which make good view points or starts for hikes. In Solothurn for example taking the Postbus to Balmberg costs 6.40CHF whereas taking the train to Oberdorf and the cable car to Weissenstein would cost twice as much.

Swimming:

* Swimming is very popular in summer anywhere from urban rivers to mountain lakes. Almost everywhere has a swimming pool or Lido where you can change and have an area with various activities or leisure features for a price. But mostly you can very easily find somewhere to jump in for free. Just be careful in rivers – see what the locals do in places like Bern where it can be fast and dangerous.

Cycling:

* A number of places (Zurich, Geneva, La Chaux-de-Fonds, Le Locle, Neuchâtel and the Canton of Valais) offer free/cheap bike rental during the summer - http://www.schweizrollt.ch/ . Bring 20CHF for deposit and ID has to be shown.

Winter sports:

* Following the winter prepared paths is free, and renting a sled for a day is fairly cheap (about 15CHF).

* Many resorts have special discount days or offers.

**----Misc----**

* If you have student ID then give it a shot.

* There is free Wifi at bigger train stations (accessed via a code sent to you by SMS). Likewise the yellow Post Buses have free Wifi which you can use during the ride or just hanging out by them at a station.

* In touristy and border areas you can often pay with euros but it is generally best not to unless you really don’t want to get some CHF. Typically they take euros at a 1:1 price to the CHF, but the euro is worth more than the CHF so you are making a loss. You might also not get change back if you pay in Euros.

* Depending on what you want to see you could even stay over the border and drive in each day, but that would be too much effort to be worth the saving for visiting most of the country (especially most of the popular tourist areas are not in the border regions).

* If you live in Switzerland then consider [REKA]( https://reka.ch/en/rekaholidays/Seiten/reka-holidays.aspx) which is a supplemented service aimed at family holidays in Switzerland. You can also buy Reka-checks which is essentially pretend money that costs less than the face value and can be used at a number of hotels/restaurants/cable cars/trains all over Switzerland.

* The [Rega](https://www.rega.ch/en/home.aspx) is the mountain rescue service (phone: 1414). You can also download the Rega app to your phone which you can allow to use your location should you need to call for help from an unknown spot. For 30CHF per person a year you can [become a Rega patron]( https://www.rega.ch/en/rega-patron/become-a-patron?rnw-widget=goenner-werden), this supports the mountain rescue service and means that (funds allowing) they will reduce/waive the rescue fees if you need help. That 30CHF could save you a hell of a lot a money.",t2_n810i,False,,0,False,My guide to cheap (or at least more affordable) travel in Switzerland (V2).,[],r/Shoestring,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_igadrd,False,dark,0.97,,public,299,2,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,299,,False,self,1598366803.0,,[],{},,True,,1598384114.0,text,6,,,text,self.Shoestring,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I posted a previous version of this a while back, but as I have expanded it quite a bit here is a new post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/85jbdn/resources_for_switzerland/""&gt;More Swiss resources&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---General Points---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switzerland is expensive to visit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switzerland is well known for being expensive in comparison with surrounding countries (and most other countries in the world). Even a basic McDonalds meal will be painfully expensive to most visitors. If you are careful then a fun (if basic) trip can be had for less than 70CHF a day, or with eating out and spending on activities for more like 150CHf per day. If you are really hardcore and wild camp and eat what is basic enough to stay alive then 10CHF might be possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living and working here you do at least have much higher pay than elsewhere and so very strong buying power. As someone living and working in Switzerland I mostly do daytrips or just for 1-2 nights at weekends, and so am lucky as most of the concerns of costs are covered by the salary and not being far from home. I do try and keep costs down so I have learnt quite a bit myself in how to avoid painful prices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultimately if you really are on a tight budget and want to see the Alps then France, Austria, Germany, and Slovenia are all cheaper and offer much of the same.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with Swiss watches the appeal is partly in the historical branding and the popular mindset, rather than Switzerland being the be-all-and-end-all of the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not everything is that expensive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basics for travel are expensive (food/accommodation/transport) but many activities are actually cheaper than elsewhere. Compared to say London where many attractions are £20+ ($26 USD) or even the insane 200 KN ($31 USD) to walk the walls in Dubrovnik many Swiss attractions are quite reasonable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entry to the Château de Chillon is 13.5 CHF ($15 USD); less than half the price of the Tower of London and cheaper than most other castles in the UK.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A return ticket on my local cable car to a high ridge with panoramic views of the Alps and into French and Germany costs less than the half hour spin on the London Eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you google around there are plenty of sites and blogs with suggestions in general, or for specific places&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=""https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-gb/affordable-switzerland.html""&gt;official tourist website&lt;/a&gt; has a dedicated section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=""https://www.englishforum.ch/travel-day-trips-free-time/2028-days-out-good-deals-free-switzerland.html""&gt;English Swiss forum&lt;/a&gt; has plenty of threads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lost in Switzerland has some interesting ideas like &lt;a href=""https://lostinswitzerland.com/save-money/""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://lostinswitzerland.com/meet-the-bloggers/""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For specific locations &lt;a href=""https://www.tripsavvy.com/geneva-on-a-budget-1508340""&gt;Tripsavvy have a good page on Geneva&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://www.greyworldnomads.com/zurich-on-a-budget/""&gt;Greyworldnomads have a good page on Zürich&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though if you spend much time searching through the rest of the results you will find that most pages just offer the same few fairly obvious bits of advice (go to the supermarket etc).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be sure to double check the official details of anything I list on here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things change with time and due to the size and scope of this post I am not going in depth with all the details – be sure to read up on the terms and conditions of any pass or other offers rather than just what is on here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be wary of advice from randoms online.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen people complain about absurd prices (that a small lunch cost them 45CHF, or a simple takeaway sandwich cost them 20CHF) that simply are insane and exceptions rather than the rule (if they were even real to start with). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise context is important: I have seen visitors from various parts of the USA claim Swiss food prices in the shops are cheaper, comparable, and far more expensive than back home (which may well all have been true).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;----Accommodation-----&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Official accommodation (which should include Airbnb) will give you a guest card in many cities and tourist focused areas. The exact benefits vary but normally include free local transport and free/discounted activities. Sometimes cable car rides will be included for free too. Usually you can look up what is included online beforehand (&lt;a href=""https://jungfrauregion.swiss/en/summer/services/guestcard/""&gt;eg: for the Jungfrau region&lt;/a&gt;). You get the guest card at check in and it is valid until the end of the day that you check out on, sometimes you can print your accommodation reservation and use that to travel for free on the day of arrival before you check in too (again check the local website to see if that is valid). Mostly you only get the benefits in the town/village and places 10-20 minutes away, &lt;a href=""https://www.ticino.ch/en/ticket.html""&gt;but in the beautiful and underrated canton of Ticino it covers the entire canton&lt;/a&gt; which is an incredible deal (if you are day tripping out of a main base then you can easily save more on transport than you spend on accommodation, especially as campsites are valid accommodation). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important factor here is season; January/February will be high season for skiing in the mountains (with December/March as the shoulder season), July/August will be high season for summer everywhere (with June/September as the shoulder season), and in most areas April/May and October/November are off season. So if you go to the Alps in May or October it will be much easier to find cheap accommodation than in August or February. The flip side is that not everything will be open or doable in the shoulder or off seasons (but it can still be worth visiting if you just want to enjoy the landscape but don’t have a certain hike or peak you are dead set on doing). For cities like Lugano that are more focused on summer tourism and don’t have a local ski resort  then it will be much cheaper in the winter months like February than during the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; help to look to lesser known areas. You might be able reduce accommodation costs by staying somewhere nice but unknown. The difference probably won’t be significant, but if for example you stay in Täsch rather than the more famous and popular neighbouring Zermatt you will likely find more budget options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sticking to one area for longer will help cut transport costs down. Jumping several hours by train everyday will get expensive fast without a general pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If breakfast isn’t included and is more than 10CHF, then unless you are a heavy morning eater you might better off popping to a café or bakery for a coffee and bite to eat instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourist tax might not be included in the listed price (typically 2-3CHF per person per night). Likewise check for a non-listed cleaning fee if it is an apartment or Airbnb, this might not be too bad if it is after a week but could be a very nasty add-on for just a night or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where to look:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from the standard options like Booking and Airbnb for finding rooms you might also want to look into &lt;a href=""https://alp.holidaybooking.ch/?language=en""&gt;https://alp.holidaybooking.ch/?language=en&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=""https://www.rooms.ch/""&gt;https://www.rooms.ch/&lt;/a&gt; , and &lt;a href=""https://bnb.ch/""&gt;https://bnb.ch/&lt;/a&gt; , and &lt;a href=""https://www.bauernhof-ferien.ch/""&gt;https://www.bauernhof-ferien.ch/&lt;/a&gt; , and &lt;a href=""https://www.myfarm.ch/en/accommodation""&gt;https://www.myfarm.ch/en/accommodation&lt;/a&gt; especially their &lt;a href=""https://www.myfarm.ch/en/sleep-on-straw#dontPreselectRegion=true&amp;amp;resultsPerPage=&amp;amp;tagIds=-4912901150941820""&gt;sleep in straw&lt;/a&gt; options which can be as low as 30CHF with breakfast included, and &lt;a href=""https://naturfreunde.ch/haeuser/""&gt;https://naturfreunde.ch/haeuser/&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://hotelcard.com/en?change_locale=en""&gt;Swiss Hotel Card&lt;/a&gt; requires a paid membership (99CHF per year) but gives you 50% off bookings at participating hotels in Switzerland, Austria, Germany, and Italy. In many Swiss hotels this would pay for itself after 2 nights (or just 1). It does seem to be focused on helping hotels during the off-season so the website states that only “75% of the time” is open (but that is still good for domestic tourists). I have not used this myself yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.couchsurfing.com/""&gt;Couchsurfing&lt;/a&gt; is free, but that is more about being a part of something rather than just a cheap place to crash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hostels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hostels can be had for as low as 20CHF for a bunk in a shared room if you are going to a popular tourist-heavy location like Interlaken or Luzern. But they are not always that cheap (especially in a ski resort in winter when a dorm bed can set you back 50CHF or more). Or even the cheapest option: a private room for 2 people in a budget hotel can be cheaper than 2 beds in a dorm. Check &lt;a href=""https://www.hostelz.com/""&gt;https://www.hostelz.com/&lt;/a&gt; in addition to Hostelworld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youthhostel.ch/en/""&gt;YHA hostels&lt;/a&gt; whilst not the cheapest are a good budget option that can be found all over the country, they tend to be family/relaxed places rather than party hostels. They are always clean, come with a good breakfast and some like Grindelwald have unbeatable views. The buildings tend to be very nice (in some cases like Burgdorf they are renovated castles). Sadly most don’t have a guest kitchen or fridge (check the info page for each location), but do offer cheap starter/main/dessert dinners for 18CHF. If you are looking at the YHAs then book on their website rather than Hostelworld etc to avoid paying the extra for not being a member (membership pays for itself after only a few nights so it is worth signing up).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Camping:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Camping. Standard campsites: &lt;a href=""http://www.tcs.ch""&gt;www.tcs.ch&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=""http://www.camping.ch""&gt;www.camping.ch&lt;/a&gt; , and &lt;a href=""http://www.sccv.ch""&gt;www.sccv.ch&lt;/a&gt;. In addition there are a few websites where you can officially find a small patch to pitch up on a farm: &lt;a href=""https://www.nomady.ch/""&gt;https://www.nomady.ch/&lt;/a&gt; , and &lt;a href=""https://www.myfarm.ch/de/campingplatz-zeltplatz#dontPreselectRegion=true&amp;amp;resultsPerPage=&amp;amp;tagIds=-3360035520941820""&gt;myfarm.ch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wild camping is complex. The best way to sum it up is &amp;quot;Prohibited but tolerated under conditions&amp;quot;. &lt;a href=""https://www.sac-cas.ch/de/umwelt/bergsport-und-umwelt/campieren-und-biwakieren/""&gt;This SAC page has the most official guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. There are some rough rules of thumb for the ideal situation: above the tree line, with the community / landowner’s permission, &lt;a href=""https://map.geo.admin.ch/?lang=de&amp;amp;layers=ch.bafu.wrz-wildruhezonen_portal,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-auen,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-hochmoore,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-flachmoore_regional,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-flachmoore,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-jagdbanngebiete,ch.bafu.schutzgebiete-schweizerischer_nationalpark,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-trockenwiesen_trockenweiden&amp;amp;layers_opacity=0.9,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.75&amp;amp;bgLayer=ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-farbe&amp;amp;zoom=0&amp;amp;topic=ech&amp;amp;E=2643780.17&amp;amp;N=1164842.39""&gt;not in a protected area&lt;/a&gt;, single tent, set up as the sun goes down and dismantle at dawn, no fire/noise/disturbance/litter. Wild camping has increased in popularity in recent years, &lt;a href=""https://www.fm1today.ch/ostschweiz/appenzellerland/zu-viele-wildcamper-am-seealpsee-135572094""&gt;iconic spots like Seealpsee are having problems with numbers&lt;/a&gt;, so try and pick a less known spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;----Transport-----&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is always a hard question to answer. The best solution will change depending on time-frame, number of people, how much you want to see/do across the country, and how much you want to keep your options open. &lt;strong&gt;Ultimately you will have to make a rough plan and calculate which option provides the best value.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public transport will get you just about anywhere you need to go and many train lines have views you won&amp;#39;t get from the roads. For public transport there are number of train passes to cover full or partial cost, the whole country or just an area, that can be bought anytime at a set price or are limited and vary in price. It can be somewhat overwhelming. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/8th1oc/my_guide_to_transport_in_switzerland/""&gt;I have written quite extensively about this, especially public transport, in a previous post&lt;/a&gt; and there are various other guides online to help there (&lt;a href=""https://lostinswitzerland.com/public-transport-101/""&gt;for example this&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few important examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Booking individual tickets in advance in itself does not make any difference to the price (unlike various other places in Europe like the UK and Germany). However from 60 days before the day of travel you can buy &lt;a href=""https://www.sbb.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets/tickets-for-switzerland/supersaver-tickets.html""&gt;“Supersaver“ tickets&lt;/a&gt; which reduce the cost by up to 70%, but are only available at off-peak times and lock you to a certain train. This can be combined with the half-fare card for further discounts. A set number of supersaver tickets are available, so depending on how in demand a certain train is they might be sold out weeks in advance or be available still just before departure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=""https://www.sbb.ch/en/leisure-holidays/travel-in-switzerland/international-guests/swiss-travel-pass.html""&gt;Swiss Travel Pass&lt;/a&gt; might seem horrifically expensive at first glance, but if you are wanting to travel far and wide from a single base it will very quickly pay for itself. In addition to standard transport it also covers most ships, a number of cable cars (even going up to Rigi Kulm and Schilthorn for no extra cost), discounts on most of the rest of the mountain transport, and free entry to most museums. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.sbb.ch/en/timetable/travel-advice/children.html#:%7E:text=Children%20under%20six%20years%20of,travel%20with%20them%20for%20free.""&gt;Children get free or discounted travel.&lt;/a&gt; Below the age of 6 children can travel free of charge if they are accompanied by somebody 12 over older who has a ticket. The &lt;a href=""https://www.sbb.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets/railpasses/junior-travelcard-children-co-travelcard.html""&gt;Junior Swiss Travel card&lt;/a&gt; costs 30CHF for a year and lets a child aged 6-16 travel for free so long as they travel with a parent. The pass is even free from the 3rd child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to be very flexible then &lt;a href=""https://fairtiq.com/en-ch/""&gt;Fairtiq&lt;/a&gt; might be worth checking out so you can hop on and off, or change direction without worrying about buying a ticket at the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving might be cheaper, especially with a group of people. However keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are renting then it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be cheaper to rent just across the border in a neighbouring country and drive in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are driving in from another country you will need to buy a 40CHF annual vignette to use the motorways (but not the smaller streets). This is actually really good value if you live here, less so if you want to just drive for a few hours to cut across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parking can be very expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some popular tourist spots like Zermatt/Wengen/Mürren are car-free so you have to pay for parking and then the transport to get you the last 10 minutes to the place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traffic offenses (speeding, not having your headlights on at all times) will result in VERY large fines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are flying into Geneva and going to the city then you can get &lt;a href=""http://www.geneva.info/transport/free-ticket/""&gt;a ticket for free transport into the city from the luggage retrieval area&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might also look into ride sharing like BlaClaCar. I have not used this, but from what I have read you should be prepared for cancelations and to be flexible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hitchhiking is possible and probably as safe as it is going to get, but I have no experience there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;----Food----&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do it yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You almost never need to buy water. Tap water is fine, and just about every fountain has drinkable water (unless there is a sign on it stating otherwise). When in the mountains you can fill up from streams assuming there isn’t a farm or animals grazing above you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supermarket food is the obvious go to. But compared to the neighbouring countries you are still paying 50% or more for food items.  Migros is the cheaper Swiss supermarket that you will find everywhere and is good quality. Denner is the slightly cheaper sister of Migros which isn’t always as easy to find. Lidl and Aldi are cheaper still, however they tend not to be in central areas or smaller towns or villages. Most supermarkets will have a small reduced section for goods near the sell by date. Be aware that supermarkets close early (typically 7pm or earlier), and outside of tourist resorts will be closed on a Sunday. There will be a shop (or a whole shopping complex) open everyday until 10pm at train or petrol stations though – but these are often more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you REALLY love bread/cheese/pasta you can feed yourself for 10CHF for the whole day (maybe get an apple too to keep the scurvy at bay).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markets on Wednesday/Saturday mornings are typically much more expensive than supermarkets. A few stands might offer free samples, but no market is big enough that you are going to fill up on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Places showing off a certain product (dairy, chocolate factory, etc) might give away a few free samples or include them in the tour price. The Kambly Erlebnis where you can eat as much as you want of their entire range without any need to buy anything is probably the best example of this, but it is rather out of the way for most trips. Whether you will save anything by going to such places compared to supermarket prices or are still able to buy cheap bags of rejects seems to be questionable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A restaurant Fondue will set you back 25CHF per person or more. &lt;a href=""https://www.swiss-meat.com/filemount/_processed_/csm_Cervelat_grilliert_933x622_f3e01dac82.jpg""&gt;But a much cheaper and equally Swiss option is to buy some Cervelat sausages from any supermarket and go roast them over a fire somewhere in the countryside&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cheapest beer is the supermarket own brands like the COOP “Prix Garantie Lager” which cost 0.5CHF per 0.5L can. Apparently these are mostly very acceptable for the price. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meat is really expensive. Avoiding it will help cut costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can bring food in with you, or if you have time then leave the country to go shopping (it is what the Swiss who live near the borders do). &lt;a href=""https://www.ezv.admin.ch/ezv/en/home/information-individuals/travel-and-purchases--allowances-and-duty-free-limit/importation-into-switzerland/duty-free-allowances--foodstuffs--alcohol-and-tobacco.html""&gt;However Switzerland is not in the EU custom zone and there are limits on how much you can bring in per person without paying customs tax&lt;/a&gt;. It is not certain you will be checked at the border, but it isn’t impossible (especially on a Saturday afternoon when many Swiss shoppers will be coming back over the border).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of takeaway options at stations and in larger towns. Figure 4-8CHF for a Sandwich/baguette or 8-10CHF for a kebab. Many cheap food stands might close by 7pm, or earlier if they are just aimed to commuters/shoppers, but there should always be something open to 10pm in any decent sized town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a chain of cafes/outlets that sell day-old bread and baked goods sourced from local bakeries at a reduced price – &lt;a href=""http://www.aess-bar.ch/""&gt;ÄSS-BAR&lt;/a&gt; (meaning edible). These are only in the bigger cities at the moment, but have central locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apps like “Too good to go” or “Homemade” are an option for finding cheap food (though outside of the bigger cities you might have very limited or no options). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some areas have special deal packages you can buy, like &lt;a href=""https://www.zweifuereins.ch/""&gt;“Zwei Für Eins”&lt;/a&gt; (two for one). However that is better suited to residents rather than short term visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migros restaurants are a budget friendly favourite. You can easily get a good meal for 15CHF (typically lunch as they are closed later in the evenings and all day on Sundays). The restaurants in the Manor department stores are also well regarded, some have quite nice views too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restaurants do not have to be as expensive as some people make out. You can easily find a Rösti or pizza for about 15CHF. A good dinner with drinks for 2 people for less than 50CHF should be easy to come across. Another option is to look for fixed menus at lunch time which will offer a good meal for 15-20CHF (especially at Italian or Asian places).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding coffee for less then 5CHF (and not a big one at that) will be very hard. My record is 3.5 CHF in Vallorbe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t want to know what a cocktail at a fancy club is going to cost you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;----Activities----&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously do something weather suitable. Money for a cable car ride is better spent on a sunny day than a wet and foggy one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take advantage of the free information. The quality of information you get through the &lt;a href=""https://map.geo.admin.ch/""&gt;Swiss topographic maps&lt;/a&gt; (see the Swisstopo phone app for one the go) is very useful for planning trips. It is very detailed, quick to load and allow all kinds of layers like hiking routes to be added is incredible and way beyond anything I have seen elsewhere – and all for free. Likewise the &lt;a href=""https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/""&gt;MeteoSwiss website&lt;/a&gt; (and app) offer lots of information and various maps to help plan your days. Being a popular destination for 200+ years means that there are endless sources for reading up on ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just walking around and taking things in is an obvious choice: most sights in towns like the churches, walls, and old towns are free to explore. All the main sights in Luzern (Lucerne) are free and easy to see by foot &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/afin8w/my_guide_to_luzern_lucerne_switzerland/""&gt;(see the tour suggestion in this post)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free walking tours exist in most cities. In Bern you can even book a free tour around the Parliament building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://blog.tagesanzeiger.ch/datenblog/index.php/865/schweizer-museen-im-check""&gt;You can use the list at the bottom of this article to see free museums (click to arrange by &lt;em&gt;Eintritt&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;, others are free on certain days like a certain Sunday of month, otherwise 10-12CHF is a fairly standard price. If you plan to visit lots of museums then &lt;a href=""https://www.museumspass.ch/en/where-to-use-my-museum-pass/""&gt;the Museum Pass&lt;/a&gt; might be worth a look – the Museum Pass is included in the Swiss Travel Pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you travel by public transport you can get &lt;a href=""https://www.sbb.ch/en/leisure-holidays.html""&gt;special Leisure deals with SBB that reduce the cost of some activities&lt;/a&gt;. For example in summer 2020 there is an offer for the FIFA World Football Museum that gives you 20% reduction on the journey to the location and back, and 20% reduction on admission to the Museum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larger and/or more popular places will have more extensive listings for free and budget events. For example &lt;a href=""https://www.zuerich.com/en/visit/things-to-do-for-free""&gt;Zürich on a Budget&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://www.zuerichunbezahlbar.ch/events/""&gt;Zürich unbezahlbar&lt;/a&gt; for Zürich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Bern you can see the bears for free and various other places have free wildlife parks (typically the free or cheaper ones will focus on local animals such as &lt;a href=""https://www.wildnispark.ch/""&gt;Wildnispark Zürich Langenberg&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=""https://tierpark-biel.ch/""&gt;Biel Tierpark&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Festivals like Swiss National Day (August 1st) and Fasnacht (February time) provide free entertainment through fireworks, parades, and various other kinds of craziness. These range from Christmas markets to the burning of explosive wooden effigies &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/8qkvjl/my_list_of_the_most_interestinguniquemad/""&gt;(I have a list of more unique Swiss events here)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shopping:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manor/ COOP often sell the standard souvenirs and chocolates that you find in tourist shops but might well be cheaper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiking, cable cars, and enjoying the views in general:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The views are free. But getting to them can be expensive, or otherwise require quite a bit of effort. The fitter you are the more you can do without having to take a cable car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resorts give you information about what is open/closed, what there is to do, and usually have multiple webcams showing the conditions at various locations. There is no excuse for paying a wodge of cash to find that all you can do is walk around a small viewing platform and see the same rain that you were already in below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have the Swiss Travel Pass you get a free ride on most boats, or up a number of cable cars and some mountain trains. Typically to those where there is a village, but it even goes to Schilthorn and the top of Rigi. If you don’t get a free ride then you should get a 50% discount off the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check ahead on the website for a cable car if you are hoping to get a discount with your Swiss Pass or half fare card. It works almost everywhere, but some resort areas (eg Davos) only give a discount if you are staying there and have a guest card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you will get an early bird / good morning ticket discount on cable cars or other mountain transport. Jungfraujoch for example has discounted Good Morning and Good Afternoon tickets if you are only up early or late, and Niederhorn gives you a free return if you go up before 9am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unsung Postbus is very cheap for what they offer. They will not get you to mountain peaks, but you can get higher up valleys or passes, which make good view points or starts for hikes. In Solothurn for example taking the Postbus to Balmberg costs 6.40CHF whereas taking the train to Oberdorf and the cable car to Weissenstein would cost twice as much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swimming:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swimming is very popular in summer anywhere from urban rivers to mountain lakes. Almost everywhere has a swimming pool or Lido where you can change and have an area with various activities or leisure features for a price. But mostly you can very easily find somewhere to jump in for free. Just be careful in rivers – see what the locals do in places like Bern where it can be fast and dangerous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cycling:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A number of places (Zurich, Geneva, La Chaux-de-Fonds, Le Locle, Neuchâtel and the Canton of Valais) offer free/cheap bike rental during the summer - &lt;a href=""http://www.schweizrollt.ch/""&gt;http://www.schweizrollt.ch/&lt;/a&gt; . Bring 20CHF for deposit and ID has to be shown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winter sports:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the winter prepared paths is free, and renting a sled for a day is fairly cheap (about 15CHF).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many resorts have special discount days or offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This - &lt;a href=""https://www.snow4free.ch/de/""&gt;https://www.snow4free.ch/de/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;----Misc----&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have student ID then give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is free Wifi at bigger train stations (accessed via a code sent to you by SMS). Likewise the yellow Post Buses have free Wifi which you can use during the ride or just hanging out by them at a station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In touristy and border areas you can often pay with euros but it is generally best not to unless you really don’t want to get some CHF. Typically they take euros at a 1:1 price to the CHF, but the euro is worth more than the CHF so you are making a loss. You might also not get change back if you pay in Euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on what you want to see you could even stay over the border and drive in each day, but that would be too much effort to be worth the saving for visiting most of the country (especially most of the popular tourist areas are not in the border regions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you live in Switzerland then consider &lt;a href=""https://reka.ch/en/rekaholidays/Seiten/reka-holidays.aspx""&gt;REKA&lt;/a&gt; which is a supplemented service aimed at family holidays in Switzerland. You can also buy Reka-checks which is essentially pretend money that costs less than the face value and can be used at a number of hotels/restaurants/cable cars/trains all over Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=""https://www.rega.ch/en/home.aspx""&gt;Rega&lt;/a&gt; is the mountain rescue service (phone: 1414). You can also download the Rega app to your phone which you can allow to use your location should you need to call for help from an unknown spot. For 30CHF per person a year you can &lt;a href=""https://www.rega.ch/en/rega-patron/become-a-patron?rnw-widget=goenner-werden""&gt;become a Rega patron&lt;/a&gt;, this supports the mountain rescue service and means that (funds allowing) they will reduce/waive the rescue fees if you need help. That 30CHF could save you a hell of a lot a money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

,Shoestring,"I see a lot of vague info online from airlines and other tourism focused businesses regarding refunds in the event of cancellation of travel plans due to COVID. I'm wondering what customers' actual experiences have been when you tried to recover funds invested in travel that is now not possible. Also, if you purchased travel insurance, did it cover your COVID-related cancellations?

My experience:

I had two trips booked pre-COVID, one for a large US city that became the national COVID epicenter while I was supposed to be there, and one for five countries in Europe in the fall.

I canceled my domestic VRBO a month out, just before the second and final payment was due, and lost about $250. I had also purchased a museum pass for $200, which can be used for up to a year after purchase, and I don't know if I will be able to reschedule that trip in that time frame. I bought travel insurance through VRBO and the airline, and both say that COVID doesn't qualify because I wasn't actively dying. I have American airfare credit for my non-refundable ticket, which will probably expire before I can use it.

For my Europe trip in the fall, I booked US-Europe airfare on United and two Air France flights between EU and non-EU countries. I booked an apartment on VRBO in a country that is currently tightly locked down, and my other hotel reservations can be canceled without penalty. Currently, I could not enter any of my destination countries with a US passport, and I don't blame them.

One of my Europe flights has now been canceled by Air France about 3 months in advance and I was automatically booked on a new flight. I will probably take advantage of this opportunity to seek a refund for my non-refundable ticket.

Edit: Thank you for all of the very helpful info! It seems like the low cost airlines have the worst customer service (surprise!), and that the first answer you get may not be the final answer, but it helps if you spend 12 hours on the phone. And many people have found it easier to get a refund from their credit card company than directly from the airline or vacation rental, but there may be a maximum time after purchase that you can file a claim. That last part is tricky, since so many people were waiting and seeing in the early months of COVID.

,Shoestring,"Hello!

So like many of you, I have been resorting to camping locally due to the coronavirus restrictions so my girlfriend and I have been finding places to beach camp over the central and northern California coasts. One problem I'm facing is that where I am from in California, most of the beach camping sites are booked literally *until December*.  If anyone has any answers to any of these questions, I would be super appreciative, and I'm sure other NorCal campers would be too. if you have a rec for a site that's a little inland but is definitely a cool spot, those are okay too, although we would like to avoid first fires. Thanks



Are there places where youcan just park your car (I have an SUV) and sleep and cook out the back?

Are there places secluded enough where you can maybe park at a trailhead and set up a tent once your some yards in? 

Are there places where we could just park my car and sleep? (My trunk has a bed)

Could you theoretically camp in the ""closed"" campsites (like the Bicentennial Campsite in the Marin headlands north of San Francisco) and not be bothered by rangers, so long as we didn't start a campfire?

For wilderness/BLM areas like Usal beach and the whole lost coast, do you have to camp in the designated areas or could I pitch a tent right on the beach?

In mid September I am planning on going on a relatively low difficulty, 2 night backpacking/camping trip to Sawtooth Lake in the Sawtooth National Recreation Area, Idaho. I will be going with my girlfriend who has never backpacked before. I myself have backpacked once ever; to the Havasupai campgrounds in the Grand Canyon which required a 10 mile hike in and out. I've been lurking on the various outdoors-related subreddits trying to learn as much as I can about what it takes to be prepared to backpack/camp safely on my own. Though I've done my own research on the trail and required gear, I'm hoping that you kind folk can help me by providing additional tips/suggestions/criticisms.

What I Need/Desire

* Water Filtration System
   * considering--&gt; Platypus GravityWorks 4L \[11.5 oz\]--&gt; I know of lighter weight options like the sawyer squeeze but I'm already spending a good amount of money and would like to buy something I can use when I take family and friends car camping as well. So a long term purchase. Plus my gf and I are beginners so trying to be comfortable at base camp.
* A sleeping bag for the gf
   * haven't looked into it but don't need anything fancy. Just whatever will be comfortable, affordable, and get the job done in terms of keeping her warm in Idaho in September.
* Sleeping pad/s for the two of us
   * again, looking for a blend of affordable, durable, and comfortable
* A Bear Canister
   * I know nothing, pls help
* A GPS Navigator
   * Considering a Gamin Mini as it seems to be the most popular. Hella expensive though so wondering if any other alternatives are available. How necessary is a gps system on a short trip like this?
* Suggestions for a sufficient amount of food for 2 people and 2 nights at base camp, including the 5 mile hike in and out
* Stove fuel suggestions
* Kitchen Supplies. Suggestions please
* Water Bottle Suggestions
   * I've seen lots of redditors claiming to simply use a smart water bottle as it's lightweight and durable.
* Clothing Suggestions for both of us
   * What do you usually wear/pack that is comfy, keeps you warm and maybe even helps keep you from smelling too bad. How many clothing items do you bring?
   * Also, SHOES!! My hike involves a decent amount of switchbacks through water, wondering what your favorite options are.
* Toiletries/Hygiene Items Suggestions
* Trash Suggestions
* Human Waste Suggestions (e.g., trowel vs. bagging it up)

Thank you so very much if you've made it this far. I want this trip to be fun (it's for both of our birthdays) but also of course safe. I mentioned this a few times already but when it comes to gear I'm looking for a good blend of affordable, durable, and comfortable. Though it will not be too long, this will be the first backpacking trip where I am the leader so I want to make sure that I do not leave anything out. I am extremely open to all suggestions, comments and criticisms. Most of the gear I already possess was purchased on [r/GearTrade](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearTrade/) or was given to me as a gift.

Finally, I'd love to hear HOW you all go about your backpacking/camping activities. Your favorite tips and tricks from additional ""luxury"" items, to your most useful cost/time/effort cutting strategies, to your favorite on the trail songs. Thank you!!

&lt;p&gt;In mid September I am planning on going on a relatively low difficulty, 2 night backpacking/camping trip to Sawtooth Lake in the Sawtooth National Recreation Area, Idaho. I will be going with my girlfriend who has never backpacked before. I myself have backpacked once ever; to the Havasupai campgrounds in the Grand Canyon which required a 10 mile hike in and out. I&amp;#39;ve been lurking on the various outdoors-related subreddits trying to learn as much as I can about what it takes to be prepared to backpack/camp safely on my own. Though I&amp;#39;ve done my own research on the trail and required gear, I&amp;#39;m hoping that you kind folk can help me by providing additional tips/suggestions/criticisms.&lt;/p&gt;

,Shoestring,"It will be for myself and my girlfriend, however, we are broke college students in need of some ideas on how to keep costs low. We’re into the hiking scene and would like to see some snow and good views while we’re there.

We’d likely be flying out from MCO(Orlando airport) or the Orlando-Sanford airport.

Personally, I have been to Steamboat Springs, Denver, Loveland, and Breckenridge. These were all as a child though and I don’t know much about the cost althought I will say these locations were very tourist orientated, which is something I’d like to avoid. 

The local, lowkey experience would be best.

,Shoestring,"This is what I get for booking through a sketchy third party site. My boyfriend is a med student and had a few days off after Step 1 and before his rotations started, so we booked a trip to Mexico back in December. Since he's a med student and I don't make a ton of money, we booked through Cheap Caribbean which he had used before with no problems. 

Fast forward to about 3 weeks ago, we decide traveling to Mexico isn't the most socially responsible thing to do right now, and I attempt to call to cancel our trip. There's a 2+ hour wait time, and the recording advises to wait until within 72 hours of your travel date to cancel. Hoping the flight gets cancelled earning me a refund instead of a travel credit, I hang up and plan to try back later. We're meant to leave for Mexico on July 11. 

On July 9, I call back fully prepared to sit on hold forever. I wait for 2 hours and 20 minutes, tell the representative I'm cancelling the trip because we don't want to travel now, he puts me on hold to look into the resort's cancellation policy. He comes back on the line confused because he can't find the resort's policy, and asks me to wait while he asks his supervisor for help.

He then comes back on the line confused and kind of laughing, and tells me that the resort had permanently closed. Again, we're meant to leave in TWO DAYS and no one had contacted us to tell us. I can't even imagine the headache it would have been to show up in Mexico, not be able to find the transportation we booked to the hotel, attempt to contact them or take a taxi there, and then find out that we had nowhere to stay for the following week. 

Their website says nothing about this closure--I had been monitoring it closely to see what safety precautions they were taking and whether they advised people to keep their travel plans or not. They had a full list of safety precautions and policies, but nowhere do they mention that the resort is PERMANENTLY CLOSED.

At least I got a full refund on the travel I was meaning to cancel anyways, but thank you current events for saving me from being stranded in Mexico for three weeks.

I can&amp;#39;t even imagine the headache it would have been to show up in Mexico, not be able to find the transportation we booked to the hotel, attempt to contact them or take a taxi there, and then find out that we had nowhere to stay for the following week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their website says nothing about this closure--I had been monitoring it closely to see what safety precautions they were taking and whether they advised people to keep their travel plans or not. They had a full list of safety precautions and policies, but nowhere do they mention that the resort is PERMANENTLY CLOSED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least I got a full refund on the travel I was meaning to cancel anyways, but thank you current events for saving me from being stranded in Mexico for three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: IHG is not contacting customers or third party agents to say they&amp;#39;ve closed Holiday Inn Resort Los Cabos, at least I got a full refund for travel I was cancelling due to current events&lt;/p&gt;

,Shoestring,"Hey,

In my [last post](https://reddit.com/r/Shoestring/comments/hf0ojg/advice_on_evening_in_paris_from_home_in_barcleona/) I told about our plans for Parisian evening, which me and my wife enjoyed a lot, and were eager to continue doing our weekly date nights in different cities.

I have also taken your ideas around music and live events which I want to try.

This week we are having a date in Tokyo, while being at home in Barcleona.

Date: 4th of JULY 2020 

We will have to plan it earlier in the day to catch a day/early evening for Japan time.

Dinner (54€): This time around we have more options to choose with variety of sushi sets and my wife being a fan of Japanese cooking. We will take a simple set of sushi rolls and salmon sashimi. Fried salmon with rice 🍚 Some fancy version miso soup🍲 Bottle of Sake Sho Chiki Bai (not many options to choose from)

Tour (8€): we will have a 1 hours tour [Tokyo Local Sacred Tour](https://oqqur.com/events/tokyo-local-tram-tour/), that is live and is 360 degrees, we are promised to learn about the lucky cat and see couple of Buddhist temples.

Experience (13€): As a huge fan of origami art, always wanted to see the traditional way of doing it, so this online experience was a must for me. [Origami and the culture of Japan](https://abnb.me/6B0ixTr1O7)

Atmosphere: I found a nice [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/1269581343/playlist/0ig2IiVTh2rnTcTgHZPHPi?si=ZZEoiUQEQbK7p1IyWi56ZQ) with traditional Japanese music

Total: 79€

Would love you thoughts and suggestions as usual.

,Shoestring,"Hey, 

I am based in Barcelona, and although the lockdown has been lifted across EU, I think we should try to stay at home. So I have an idea to make a Parisian experience for me and my wife from home. Would love your feedback, thoughts and suggestions: 

Date: 27 of JUNE 2020

Dinner: I’ll probably buy some french red wine and order Steak TarTar and oysters from Ubereats. Surprisingly there are not too many french restaurants that deliver within Barcelona. 

Tour: we will have a 1 hours tour about [Mysteries of Paris](https://oqqur.com/events/mysterious-paris), that is live and is 360 degrees.

Experience: wanted to find some kind of Meetup to chat with locals who speak English, and could not find anything good. Would love your suggestions here, in the meantime planning to take on [Bobsled from an Parisian Olympian ](https://abnb.me/K30pWEjYz7)

Would love you thoughts and also suggestions on wine. 

Thanks

EDIT: Thanks a lot for all the feedback, here are some things I will revise for upcoming date nights;) 
1) I will probably cook something myself with combination of cold assortments of cheese and breads. Thanks for pointers to: u/whereisthenarwhal, u/freemakerlucy, and specifically to u/PanTroglodyte for pointing out the raw food I planned.
2) Music a big piece I have missed, thank you u/Tristaine1
3) I'll go ahead with Exquisite Cremant du Jura thanks to u/mumstheword999


Also here is a little budget estimation:
1) wine 10€
2) dinner ~ 60€

4) Olimpian Bobsled Experience 12€

I don't care who you vote for. For US citizens check your voter registration status at [vote.org](https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/?gclid=Cj0KCQjww_f2BRC-ARIsAP3zarEpQweKTNSKrJWjtQDm0w3PwKTPYMDIzQ8Avv2lpbOulG5QwdNMEsYaAq80EALw_wcB)

I have a hobby of aviation and finding cheap airfare. I thought rather than just looking at random flights I could do something fun and pay something forward.

Give me your flights in something like this format the more specific the better. Please COPY and EDIT the below format :)

\* Origin: ex. NYC (JFK, EWR, LGA)

\* DEST: ex. Miami/FLL

\* Departure Dates: ex. 7/1 or 7/1-&gt;7/20

\* Return Dates: ex. 7/1 or 7/1-&gt;7/20. IF One-way just say NA

\* LENGTH: ex. 4 days (If you say 1 week please say 7 days or 7-8 days ect.)

\* Other: ex No Layovers over 4 hours.

\* Expected Budget: \~$120 (optional, Just want to see if I can get below this goal)

\* Bags: Carry-On (Goes in the overhead bin)? Personal Item (fits under the seat in front of you)? Checked Bag? This actually matters in the difference in price alot. EX. 1 carry-on, no checked bags.

Again, PLEASE be as specific and as unambiguous as possible. ie 7/15-&gt;7/30  or +/- 1 day is better than ""Late July"" or ""flexible"".

Also, I did not get to everyone last time, so feel free to repost requests.

,Shoestring,"
I’m warning you, AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COST. Just a word of warning this company works under three names Farestore, Skybooker and Destina Travel. Avoid all three!

I booked a flight with this company and due to the coronavirus the flight was cancelled. So I was given two options, a partial refund ($400) of my $840 ticket or $840 of credit to be used towards a different flight.

At first I decided to use the credit but then when I requested a date in November for the same route the company wanted an ADDITIONAL $900 from me for this route. When comparing flights for the same time on different websites I was getting return flights for about $1,000 in total, this company wanted $1,700 from me.

So I decided I would take the refund. I was told I would have my refund within 45 business days... 47 business days went by, no money. So I posted a review of this company online.

I was then called by the company and threaten, “do you want to continue to write reviews online or do you want to get your money back”... what the fuck right??

 So after going back and forward and realizing the $900 they wanted originally was a bit much the company rebooked me on my flight in November for an additional $50.

Once the flights are confirmed I call to pay my $50 as first agreed on the phone, then by email and once more by phone before I pay. Then my card is charged for $70. I later email the company asking what this is about and apparently the extra $20 is a ‘service fee’ to book the flight fare. 

I honestly would avoid this company at all costs. Everytime you contact them by email a new customer service rep takes up your email and gives you a copy and paste answer from his word document. They will make your life a nightmate... I now have a flight booked under them in November and I wouldn’t be surprised if I turned up at the airport and my tickets don’t exist!

,Shoestring,"Hey guys, I was suggested to post here from /r/solotravel. Just gonna copy and paste here and hope you find it useful! Here's the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/gjx116/i_spent_this_much_on_a_5_day_solo_trip_to/).

Nicaragua is a great place to visit if you’re looking for an inexpensive option. It is similar to Southeast Asia but without flying across the globe if your home base is in North America like me. It has a healthy number of backpackers but isn’t overrun with tourists. I went in May of last year.

The breakdown of the costs including the flight was (all numbers in USD):

* Flight: $282
* Food: $60
* Transportation: \~$40
* Excursions: $85
* Lodging: $71

**The trip totaled about $540**. You definitely can do it for cheaper but this was what I spent. For the really detailed rundown with pictures and notes, I planned my trip [here](https://blueplanit.co/view-trip/utwtzfgzty/5-day-solo-trip-to-nicaragua).

I specifically went to 3 cities: Managua, Leon, and Granada, however, spent less than a day in both Managua and Granada. Most of my time was in Leon and the surrounding area.

I loved Leon. The main thing I wanted to do there was volcano boarding down Cerro Negro which is an active volcano. It takes about an hour to get to the volcano from Leon and we were brought there by a tour group called Bigfoot Hostel. Sliding down the volcano on a wooden board is actually pretty difficult, but there's a technique they teach you so you can go fast. Honestly, the adrenaline rush from clocking in at 50 km/hr at one point in the descent will make me remember this trip forever.

Other than that, I hiked up Telica, another active volcano. I checked out the beach on the west coast bordering the Pacific Ocean. I wandered around town exploring churches and cathedrals, sampled the local cuisine, and spoke a lot of broken Spanish.

In terms of getting around, I took a combination of public transport (buses, collectivos, etc.) and also a couple of taxis. In Managua, there is a transportation hub called UCA where you can catch collectivos to many different cities. It’s cheap too and everyone knows where it is so you shouldn’t have a hard time finding it.

I stayed in a couple of hostels with a private room. I could’ve saved some more money by staying in a shared room but I wanted to have some privacy.

At the end of it, I had a great experience and looking back on it, every cent was worth it.

,Shoestring,"So what’s your travel hacks for saving money on food when on the road?

Eating out is one of the great pleasures of travelling isn’t it? But it also starts to rack up on the old purse strings.

So you can save a fair bit of cash I’ve noticed if you’re a little clever and you make a effort.

For me breakfast is the most overrated meal when it comes to eating out....so I don’t, if I’m travelling in Europe I just take my breakfast cereal measured out into separate bags for the few days I’m away,I buy milk when I land and I’m good to go...breakfast is covered.

For lunch (again this is euro-centric ) I’ll go head to an indoor market where there’s always a few eateries with communal seating or if that’s not available then I’ll head to a Lidl or other cheapo supermarket and make my own sandwich/salad and go sit in a park or plaza and watch the world go buy.
Often in big cities restaurants will have a limited lunchtime special and I’ll treat myself to that but will only drink my own water.

For drinking alcohol I will treat myself and head to a few bars to drink beer... no point in travelling just to sit and count the pennies right? So I usually head to a bar around 5 to hit any happy hours and then depending on the crowd and the mood I’ll either stay out and get a takeaway on the way home or more likely hit the supermarket again to buy simple vegetables and pasta and head back to the hostel with a cheap bottle of vine and I’ll cook up a storm .... there’s always left over condiments like olive oil, salt/ pepper etc and I always gift any leftovers to other travellers.

Another thing I always avoid is buying food at the airport so before leaving I’ll make a sandwich at home or at the hostel and eat that to keep me going
I always have an empty water bottle that I ask staff at the airport restaurants to fill for me.

I realise the above is nothing new but thought I’d share how I save a few $ when travelling.

,Shoestring,"Five methods to acquire the most out of your trips:

Think About a Work-Trade Agreement.

Holiday deals might seem worth the cash and ease, but what if you can acquire all those enjoyable, native encounters and complimentary lodging? Work-trade arrangements offer you just that. How it works is easy and precisely as it sounds: You work in places doing anything from milking goats to organic agriculture to easy house sitting and several more in exchange for a roof above your head.

Hire an Apartment or do a Home Swap.

Customarily, holiday-goers have had to reserve a hotel to acquire the facilities of home in a foreign metropolis, but not anymore. Even if you’re dedicated to having a luxury holiday, mainly for a honeymoon, anniversary or big birthday, you could locate luxury lodgings at not-so-high charges. Apartment and house hires (within local guides of your destination at HomeAway.com or VRBO.com), home swaps (HomeExchange.com, LoveHomeSwap.com) and hiring single rooms inside bigger homes (Airbnb) mean that you could receive kitchen stove rights, Wi-Fi access and perfect natural features without paying too much.

Purchase Native Food and Cook.

Given that you’re visiting a place that has reachable grocery shops or farmer’s bazaars, buy native food and think about a charming picnic at one of the adjacent locations or parks. If you have kitchen access, try cooking with never-before-utilized products. In the awareness of saving cash, study in advance what’s native (and therefore, inexpensive) to your city.

Walk All Over.

In the distress of the holiday mindset, throwing unfamiliar amounts of (foreign) cash at cab drivers could frequently be a go-to routine for steering unaccustomed locations. Presuming that you’re traveling in a secure region and are able-bodied, you could come across all types of concealed places and stunning locations while steering on your own two feet.

Redefine Mementos.

Expensive tchotchkes in tourist stores and airports might summon but repel. What are mementos but a gesture to friends and family that you were thinking of them while you were away from home? You do not want a £6 keychain from a Hawaiian gift store to tell them this.

Thanks so much for the helpful feedback.

I turned 59 this year and just a few years ago did quite a bit of weekend backpacking mostly in North Carolina.  While i used to entertain thoughts of hiking the AT, PCT, John Muir, etc., tackling one of these wilderness trails (in its entirety) is no longer on my to-do list. I admire those who do (and know a few who did) but that much of a wilderness challenge is not for me.

The Camino may be something I can do once this highly infectious disease is subdued. Considering the close quarters pilgrims and others who walk the Camino shelter in, it may be a while before that happens.

Why the Camino?  While the Camino is specifically a pilgrimage for many, indeed if not for most, there are some who walk for other reasons.  For me I see the Camino as a physical and mental challenge, (hopefully) a doable one.  I love to walk and from what I’ve seen, why not walk - calmly, peacefully - through some of the most beautiful countrysides. While I don’t see this as a pilgrimage personally, I do think I’ll experience some kind of transformation by walking along this “trail” so many others from so many other times and countries have done before me. But if I don’t, that’s ok.  I expect that the comradery, drinking local wines, eating local foods and meeting locals and those from other countries will be well worth the effort.

So when I think about walking in the US, I know nothing exactly like the Camino exists here in the US, but wonder if there are walks here that incorporate some of what is available on the Camino.  Maybe there’s something regional like the Chimayo in NM - thanks for that suggestion.  I just found out about a trail called the American Discovery Trail.  My research continues.

I should of been visiting Thailand in June with my partner but have now had my flights swapped to be late December till mid Jan (hopefully can travel by then) Flying in to Bangkok and out of Phuket and that can't be changed.

At this moment the flights look really expensive, and I figured it&amp;#39;d be cool to try and sail there, or find some other method of transportation. Do you guys have any tips? Most tickets for June/July seem to be well above 1000 USD, which is a bit much for such a distance. Of course with the current unstable situation I wouldn&amp;#39;t book before confirmation it&amp;#39;s okay tk travel.&lt;/p&gt;

Example: Paris - Bucapest by bus, worth almost 100€, will only cost you 14€ with this voucher:

There's  a limit on 3 vouchers per order but you can order as many times as you want. Might prove useful for those of you who want to roam across Europe backpacking.

&gt;We have issued an airline credit for your flight. You are receiving this email as either your airline has cancelled your flight, or it was noted that you did not take your trip as scheduled because of the current situation related to COVID-19.

Does anyone know how I can get a full refund  instead of airline credit? I saw a post by someone on reddit a few days ago describing almost exactly the same scenario and how they were able to get a refund instead of credits by invoking their rights.

&lt;p&gt;We have issued an airline credit for your flight. You are receiving this email as either your airline has cancelled your flight, or it was noted that you did not take your trip as scheduled because of the current situation related to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

Because of this I've already cancelled one flight last month, will likely have to cancel a flight next month, too.  Crossing my fingers I can fly to Europe on trips booked for June and September. 

In the  meantime I've been looking at American Airlines and others that are offering no-fee changes on any flight booked now, even if it says *non-refundable.* 

Right now they are offering round trip transcontinental with carry on flights for as low as $57 starting in June and then $99 from mid-June through October.  Because I'm looking to visit some friends, I'm considering purchasing 2-4 long weekend trips at these prices, given I can change the flights for no cost but here's my question...

I'm assuming I'll have to pay the difference between the fare I purchase and the one I want to reschedule with.  Meaning, If I buy a $99 round trip flight and need to move it, there will be no fee but if the next flight I want to take is $199 I'll have to pay the $100 difference.

,Shoestring,"I have this idea I've been playing in my head for a while. An app that you could input in your budget, the number of days you would want to travel, your location, and what type of trip you would be interested in. Based on these inputs the app could generate suggestions of where to go and what to do there. Maybe you are just bored and looking for a one-day trip, maybe longer.

 I feel like spontaneity could have a big part in it. You know sometimes you just want to break away for a bit, so you could just pull up the app and have it guide you on a great trip.

I'm fairly certain similar apps exist, if you use one please let me know, the closest I found was kayak explore, however, this could be a bit more in-depth.

,Shoestring,"Hello!

My partner and I recently returned from a (shortened thanks to COVID) trip to Japan. Figured I would post our budget for those who are interested.

***Prices are for 2 people and listed in both AUD / USD***

Bear in mind that the AUD USD exchange rate is very volatile right now (I've used today's rate of $1 AUD = $0.61 USD).

&amp;#x200B;

|*Destinations*|*Total Days*|*Daily Average AUD / USD*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Tokyo &amp; Nozawaonsen|61|$79.94 / $48.95|

&amp;#x200B;

|*Category*|*Total AUD / USD*|*Daily Average AUD / USD*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Accommodation|$1,503.75 / $918.05|$24.65 / $15.05|
|Restaurants|$1,275.08 / $778.44|$20.90 / $12.75|
|Groceries|$1,059.54 / $646.45|$17.37 / $10.60|
|Transportation|$495.65 / $302.41|$8.12 / $4.95|
|Activities|$320.57 / $195.59|$5.25 / $3.20|
|Alcohol|$109.09 / $66.56|$1.78 / $1.08|
|Car Hire|$107.76 / $65.75|$1.76 / $1.07|
|Fuel|$12.50 / $7.63|$0.20 / $0.12|

Our accommodation cost is low because we had some friends/family stay in our apartment for a few weeks and they contributed towards rent. Without their input the apartment would have cost $42 AUD / $25.60 USD a night.

During this time my partner went skiing for 5 days in Nozawaonsen and those costs are included in the above tables.

We could have easily brought these costs down, but we spent the first 5ish weeks eating out twice a day :)

EDIT: I forgot to say that the above information doesn't include our flights in/out of Tokyo. We paid $291.92 AUD / $178.16 USD for a flight from Vancouver to Tokyo (This is on top of airline points) and $565 AUD / $344.82 USD for the flight to Australia.

About a week ago they segregated and sectioning off the country in to sections.

Stopped most ferries from going..  basically gave people a few days warning..  and now it's basically whatever island you're on, big or small.. you're stuck there for as long as this goes on.  I know a few islands that have no airport and no ferries.. so yes.. you're stuck.

Then cut off domestic flights.

Then gave a nationwide curfew.

Then Quarantined all of Luzon (the largest populated area including Manila) and all stores ordered to close which they are tightening more and more each day.

Now they are closing some grocery stores (like mine, the only one in town).

Which leaves one very small local/wet market (basically no canned goods) just rice, fresh veggies and fish.

Will they close this too?  Now that the grocery store is closed will they raise prices 2-5x to keep up with demand?

They're starting to give out one designated pass per family for grocery shopping.  That's ONE pass in one persons name..  basically restricting the whole rest of the family from leaving their house.

They're also forcing hotels/hostels to close.. basically trying to kick out foreigners from them and telling them 'good luck' ..

Even some locals long term apartments are telling foreigners they won't rent to them.

Pretty much all the touristy things are shut down or are being shut down in the next few days.. I think the dive shops is all that's left but I think today or tomorrow is their last day open.

This is all in the past week by the way..

So if you're thinking about going home and not willing to possibly ride this thing out through the rest of 2020 and beyond.. you may want to think about flying back home ASAP as it seems there are more restrictions by the day on air travel, hence the crazy prices I've seen to get back home (USA).

If you don't leave NOW.. this week.. you may be stuck in whatever country your in.

A few people told me they may be closing off the smaller islands in the Philippines to foreigners in April.. has anyone else heard this?

If so, what are the details?

I also heard this may be happening in Vietnam as well (Cat Ba island/Ha Long Bay) ..  

I think there's a real chance that a high percentage of touristy things will continue to get closed and it may not be worth traveling on a 'Once in a lifetime type trip' etc.

Thoughts?

NEXT DAY EDIT:. Guess it's already happening:

The island I was just about to take a ferry too is going under quarantine on Monday for a week..  which to me means.. could be extended for weeks or a month plus.

,Shoestring,"I thought I'd make this post because I remember researching and wondering if a trip like I'm on was possible and if so how to achieve it. I know my situation may not reflect that of everyone, but I want to show that it is possible to travel long term with relatively little money. I try to go into as much detail as I can, so pardon the length.

For the last 6 months I've been solo traveling around South East Asia, so far spending time in Thailand (1 month), Laos (1 month), Vietnam (3 months), and Cambodia (1 month). Its been an amazing trip and even though I haven't spent much money, I haven't once had to say ""no"" to an activity that I wanted to do. I've been a part of a Thai meditation retreat, went tubing in Vang Vieng, taken a cruise in Ha Long Bay, and explored Angkor Wat to name just a few of the many cool experiences I've had. Just because you're on a shoestring budget, does NOT mean that you can't have tons of fun along the way.

So how much does it *really* cost to travel? All things considered (without my initial flight to Asia), it costs me just under $15 a day, but the number can easily be a bit lower or higher depending on the country. If you’re wondering, Vietnam was the cheapest as I spent less than $1000 in 3 months and the others cost me between $450-600 a month.  

I like to split my travel budget into the daily essentials (food, water, shelter), the semi-essentials (long distance travel, local transportation, mobile phone, etc.), and the non-essentials (activities, alcohol, taxis, etc.). I'll break down how much things really cost and how to keep expenses down in more detail below.

Essentials:

* Food: This is my biggest expense. Depends on the country, but expect $1-3 a meal for local food where local people eat.""Local food"" in tourist restaurants is often closer to $3-6 and Western food is $5-10+ and can mirror what you'd pay in the West. Don't be afraid of local food. If a bunch of locals are eating it, it probably won't make you sick, because as the late great Anthony Bourdain once said, ""its bad business to poison your neighbors."" Food is the culture of SEA so experience it as much as you can.
* Water: You can't drink the tap water, but bottled water is cheap. $0.20-0.60 for 1.5L bottle.
* Accommodation: This depends on you. In 6 months I have never paid more than $6 for a dorm room and since figuring out the ""tricks"" I haven't paid more than $4. Almost all of them have been good and most have included a comfortable temperature at night, privacy sheets, and hot showers. The key to finding deals is to use Agoda or [Booking.com](https://booking.com/). Limit your search to places reviewed 8.0 or higher and sort by lowest price. If there are tons offered, raise the review rating and go with the highest rated place that fits your budget. Regardless of the price, if the review is 9.0+ and has more than 30 reviews, its probably a good place to stay. Private rooms are usually much more expensive, but I’ve only stayed in them a few times so I’m not as familiar. $10-15 is what I paid in Cambodia and that seems average for the region but I’m not entirely sure.

Semi-Essentials:

* Long-distance travel: This can cost a lot or a little depending on where you want to go and how you want to get there. In general, don't be afraid of night busses. Yes, there are accidents. Yes, people die. But tens of thousands of local people and tourists alike use them and almost all live through the (more or less pleasant) experience. In Vietnam, a night bus can take you 12 hours away for less than $13. You shouldn't spend more than $15 traveling city to city this way, and often it's under $10. Flights are also a viable option, as many are less than $50 and you gain time and comfort (but watch the high fees/taxes and luggage limits). Some destinations are more difficult to do on a budget than others though, as Laos to Vietnam has you choose an 18hr or so bus from hell or a $117 flight. I opted for the flight.
* Local transport: Simply one of the easiest ways to waste money if you're not careful. Always check and see if public transport is available, especially in major cities like Bangkok or Saigon. Bus fares are usually only $0.10-$0.50 while taxis are usually $2+. $2 may not sound like much, but there and back is the same as a dorm room. These costs really add up. The best option is to plan ahead and stay near the main tourist sites, so you can just walk and spend nothing.
* Mobile Phone: Get a SIM card. Besides the small fee for the physical sim (less than $5) my data in Vietnam was $0.40 per gb for a month. It's really that cheap. 

Non-Essentials:

* Activities: This is why we travel. If you're not going to experience the places you travel to, why go there? It doesn't mean that you have to spend too much to get a lot out of it. Prices vary considerably, but generally speaking temple entry is free to $3 (higher in Bangkok), historical sites are $1-5, and nature sites are free-$3. These are rough estimates, but I've rarely spent more than $5 in one place. Tours can range from the cheap, my Ha Long Bay tour was $15, to the very expensive, elephant tours are usually $75-150 (I decided against it). If you want cooking classes, its usually $15-30. If you want to save money, then never book someone to do something you can do yourself. If you don't have a choice (i.e. Ha Long Bay) then find a reputable cheap option. If you stay at quality cheap hostels, they can be of immense help with this. Don’t forget that you can splurge on an activity or two that you really want to do, so still go to Angkor Wat even though it costs $62, SCUBA diving if that’s a dream of yours, or another item on your bucket list. If won’t kill your budget if you keep costs down in other areas.
* Alcohol: Beer is king and usually pretty good. Prices range from $0.20-0.50 (Vietnam) to $0.80-$1 (Laos/Cambodia) to $1.20-$2 (Thailand) and higher in bars. It sounds cheap until you drink 6 of them and you realize you drank double what you paid for your dorm bed. If you're a heavy partier, you will have a very hard time staying under budget, especially if you drink liquor instead of beer. Doesn't mean that you can't drink and keep a moderate budget, even I can't resist a delicious BeerLao, but there's a reason alcohol and financial sense don't mix well.
* Taxis: As mentioned above, avoid taxis. If you do need them, then download Grab. It's the ""uber"" of SEA and will keep you from getting ripped off. Keep in mind the ways the locals travel and do that. In Thailand, Tuk Tuks are almost always a rip-off (besides the “red taxis”) but in Cambodia they’re the main taxi option while Vietnam relies on motorbike taxis. The locals almost always do the cheapest option, so follow their lead.
* Souvenirs: If you find a meaningful souvenir, then don't feel bad getting it. Just make sure its ethical, meaning don't buy things made from the metal from bombs (encourages dangerous scavenging), animal parts (encourages poaching), looted historical artifacts (illegal and could get you in trouble for bringing out of the country), from children (encourages them to drop out of school and continues the poverty cycle), and other discouraged practices. To find the best deals, buy items from their source or in markets where you see local people actually buying things, not just tourists.

Additional tips:

* Never think of money in terms of your own currency/prices back home. A $10 cab ride may sound cheap if you're from New York, but if the local price is $2 you're grossly overpaying. This extends to everything from food to hostels. To find the local price, ask hostel staff or ask various sellers to see how much the going rate is. For consumer goods, see what the price is at national chains like 7-11 and go from there.
* Mentally use a comparative pricing system. If your dorm costs $4 and that Starbucks costs $4 then is the drink worth losing another night of travel? At the same time, maybe a little piece of home is what you need to keep going when you feel homesick. Know the price you're willing to pay and prioritize what you're willing to spend it on.
* Sometimes prices aren't scaled the same as back home, so be careful. For example, a juice can easily cost more than a full local meal in SEA. At the same time, drinks like beer may be only a couple cents more expensive than soft drinks at dinner. It may surprise you, so remember to keep prices relative to each other, not your expectations.
* Don't get ripped off, but don't be a jerk either. Don't allow someone to overcharge you double or triple what the real cost is. At the same time, most people selling things on the street are extremely poor. Paying $0.20 more is not going to kill you, but it may mean making a sale that helps someone else get to eat that day. Find the price that you are willing to pay, and if you think its fair then don't push it unnecessarily low.
* Keep track of all purchases. I use the Tripcoin app on iOS and I've found it works great for me, especially considering it's free. I'm sure there's other options out there as well. Believe me, money is much more real when you see how much you're actually spending and it allows you to budget accordingly.
* Get an ATM fee free card before leaving and withdraw cash free from anywhere. Charles Schwab is a great option for Americans.
* Always buy travel insurance. If anything goes wrong, it pays for itself. I use World Nomads and since they more than adequately serviced my claim I'll probably stick with them. If you plan on riding a motorbike (and even if you don't plan on it) get a license and an international drivers permit before leaving to stay covered in the case of an accident.
* Consider teaching English online if you qualify and need some extra cash. One or two days working could likely fund an entire week of travel in many places.

I apologize for how long this post is, but congrats if you made it to the end. My trip is over 6 months long (and still going) but almost everything I said still applies even if you aren't planning on being gone so long. I'll be happy to answer any additional questions people have in the comments. I still plan on going to southern Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia in the next 2 months, so if anyone has any advice on those destinations I'm all ears as well.",t2_h80l10e,False,,0,False,How to Travel SEA Under $15 A Day (Including 3 Months in Vietnam For Less Than $1000!),[],r/Shoestring,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_fgxt2m,False,dark,0.97,,public,377,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,377,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1583964911.0,text,6,,,text,self.Shoestring,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;#39;d make this post because I remember researching and wondering if a trip like I&amp;#39;m on was possible and if so how to achieve it.

It doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you have to spend too much to get a lot out of it. Prices vary considerably, but generally speaking temple entry is free to $3 (higher in Bangkok), historical sites are $1-5, and nature sites are free-$3. These are rough estimates, but I&amp;#39;ve rarely spent more than $5 in one place. Tours can range from the cheap, my Ha Long Bay tour was $15, to the very expensive, elephant tours are usually $75-150 (I decided against it). If you want cooking classes, its usually $15-30. If you want to save money, then never book someone to do something you can do yourself. If you don&amp;#39;t have a choice (i.e. Ha Long Bay) then find a reputable cheap option. If you stay at quality cheap hostels, they can be of immense help with this. Don’t forget that you can splurge on an activity or two that you really want to do, so still go to Angkor Wat even though it costs $62, SCUBA diving if that’s a dream of yours, or another item on your bucket list. If won’t kill your budget if you keep costs down in other areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alcohol: Beer is king and usually pretty good. Prices range from $0.20-0.50 (Vietnam) to $0.80-$1 (Laos/Cambodia) to $1.20-$2 (Thailand) and higher in bars. It sounds cheap until you drink 6 of them and you realize you drank double what you paid for your dorm bed. If you&amp;#39;re a heavy partier, you will have a very hard time staying under budget, especially if you drink liquor instead of beer. Doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you can&amp;#39;t drink and keep a moderate budget, even I can&amp;#39;t resist a delicious BeerLao, but there&amp;#39;s a reason alcohol and financial sense don&amp;#39;t mix well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taxis: As mentioned above, avoid taxis. If you do need them, then download Grab. It&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;uber&amp;quot; of SEA and will keep you from getting ripped off. Keep in mind the ways the locals travel and do that. In Thailand, Tuk Tuks are almost always a rip-off (besides the “red taxis”) but in Cambodia they’re the main taxi option while Vietnam relies on motorbike taxis. The locals almost always do the cheapest option, so follow their lead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Souvenirs: If you find a meaningful souvenir, then don&amp;#39;t feel bad getting it. Just make sure its ethical, meaning don&amp;#39;t buy things made from the metal from bombs (encourages dangerous scavenging), animal parts (encourages poaching), looted historical artifacts (illegal and could get you in trouble for bringing out of the country), from children (encourages them to drop out of school and continues the poverty cycle), and other discouraged practices. To find the best deals, buy items from their source or in markets where you see local people actually buying things, not just tourists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never think of money in terms of your own currency/prices back home. A $10 cab ride may sound cheap if you&amp;#39;re from New York, but if the local price is $2 you&amp;#39;re grossly overpaying. This extends to everything from food to hostels. To find the local price, ask hostel staff or ask various sellers to see how much the going rate is. For consumer goods, see what the price is at national chains like 7-11 and go from there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mentally use a comparative pricing system. If your dorm costs $4 and that Starbucks costs $4 then is the drink worth losing another night of travel? At the same time, maybe a little piece of home is what you need to keep going when you feel homesick. Know the price you&amp;#39;re willing to pay and prioritize what you&amp;#39;re willing to spend it on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes prices aren&amp;#39;t scaled the same as back home, so be careful. For example, a juice can easily cost more than a full local meal in SEA. At the same time, drinks like beer may be only a couple cents more expensive than soft drinks at dinner. It may surprise you, so remember to keep prices relative to each other, not your expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get ripped off, but don&amp;#39;t be a jerk either. Don&amp;#39;t allow someone to overcharge you double or triple what the real cost is. At the same time, most people selling things on the street are extremely poor. Paying $0.20 more is not going to kill you, but it may mean making a sale that helps someone else get to eat that day. Find the price that you are willing to pay, and if you think its fair then don&amp;#39;t push it unnecessarily low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep track of all purchases. I use the Tripcoin app on iOS and I&amp;#39;ve found it works great for me, especially considering it&amp;#39;s free. I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s other options out there as well. Believe me, money is much more real when you see how much you&amp;#39;re actually spending and it allows you to budget accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get an ATM fee free card before leaving and withdraw cash free from anywhere. Charles Schwab is a great option for Americans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always buy travel insurance. If anything goes wrong, it pays for itself. I use World Nomads and since they more than adequately serviced my claim I&amp;#39;ll probably stick with them. If you plan on riding a motorbike (and even if you don&amp;#39;t plan on it) get a license and an international drivers permit before leaving to stay covered in the case of an accident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider teaching English online if you qualify and need some extra cash. One or two days working could likely fund an entire week of travel in many places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologize for how long this post is, but congrats if you made it to the end. My trip is over 6 months long (and still going) but almost everything I said still applies even if you aren&amp;#39;t planning on being gone so long. I&amp;#39;ll be happy to answer any additional questions people have in the comments. I still plan on going to southern Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia in the next 2 months, so if anyone has any advice on those destinations I&amp;#39;m all ears as well.&lt;/p&gt;

,Shoestring,"**Edit/ Update 3:** After seeing more replies that Dubrovnik is a bit overhyped and expensive, I've decided to just cut down time there, along with cutting Zagreb and adding it other places. So I'm currently planning on the following. I unfortunately don't think that within my time frame I could fit in Albania, but I'm excited of the trip and will have to make another for other Balkan countries!

**June 3-8 Split, Croatia (5 nights, 4 full days)**

**June 8- 12: Sarajevo, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina (4 nights, 3 full days)**

**June 12-16 Mostar, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina (4 nights, 3 full days)**

**June 16-19 Kotor, Montenegro (3 nights, 2 full days)**

**June 19-20 Dubrovnik, Croatia (1 night, enough time to see landmarks/ chill &amp; catch flight)**

I've added more time to split, as to take some day trips to different islands, but because of the cost of staying at many, I would rather just visit the day, but have a ""home base"" in Split (and to avoid leaving, but having to stay somewhere for only 1 night). I added more time in Mostar to allow for time to visit the areas of Herzegovina and a few other places around. I also aded more time in Kotor, Montenegro as it seems to be a bit cheaper and more charming than Dubrovnik.

::

**Edit/ Update 2:** It seems that people are saying to skip Zagreb completely, which I am fine with! So I'm thinking of adding a few nights to an island near Split. I was thinking of going to either Hvar, Brač, or Vis. That would make the updated itinerary as follows.

**June 3-7 Split, Croatia (4 nights, 3 full days)**

**June 7-9: \*\*Island near Split\*\* (2 nights, 2 days)**

**June 9- 10: Split (to be able to catch the 7am bus from Split - Sarajevo)**

**June 10-14 Sarajevo, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina (4 nights, 3 full days)**

**June 14-16 Mostar, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina (2 nights, 1 full day)**

**June 16-18 Kotor, Montenegro (2 nights, 1 full day)**

**June 18-20 Dubrovnik, Croatia (2 nights, 1 full day)**

::

**Edit**: After reading these responses, I have changed my itinerary. Let me know your thoughts on the changes!

**June 3-7 Split, Croatia (4 nights, 3 full days)**

**June 7-10 Zagreb, Croatia (3 nights, 2 full days)**

**June 10-14 Sarajevo, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina (4 nights, 3 full days)**

**June 14-16 Mostar, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina (2 nights, 1 full day)**

**June 16-18 Kotor, Montenegro (2 nights, 1 full day)**

**June 18-20 Dubrovnik, Croatia (2 nights, 1 full day)**

I have to get to Dubrovnik to catch a flight, and is the main reason I'm ending there. But seeing as it's much more expensive and filled with tourists, I'll just keep a day there to see the hype and relax a bit.

I have kept the time in Split, as I want the start of my trip to be more relaxing, time on the beach, with a day trip possible.

I need to go live somewhere cheap where I can save money on the necessities of life, like food and utilities. I need to pay down some credit card debt.   


Places I am personally interested in, in no order:

Mexico, Southeast Asia, India, Latin/South America, Eastern Europe.

My ideal criteria would be: reliable internet, beaches (learning to surf, SCUBA/snorkelling), hiking/camping opportunities, abundant wildlife, low cost of living (healthier food preferred). Cheap to rent/buy motorcycles. Somewhat safe for dental tourism.

I do have a couple of places in Canada I can stay at basically free, but food is generally expensive. It would be nice to ride my motorcycle to the destination, but I am open to renting/buying once there. I can reliably get cheap airfare to Mexico, but would be relying on Scott's Cheap Flights for anywhere else. 

I don't want to overload myself, so as much as I would love to visit some crazier places, I want a gentle transition into nomad life. So places with less of a language/cultural barrier would be preferred (I speak/read low level French, and VERY little Spanish.)

,Shoestring,"Last week I made a post on why I think shoestring travel gives you a richer experience, but now it's time to write about *how* I travel on a shoestring budget.

There are many ways I manage to travel on a shoestring budget and I've compiled a list of 10 of my favourite budget travel tips that I use. I'm interested in what you guys think, which you agree with or disagree with and which tips you would add?

**1.  Keep It Local**

The idea is to try and spend as little as the locals in underdeveloped countries and as little as the working class locals in developed countries. That means we need to eat where they eat and travel how they travel. I.e  eating at local restaurants or street food and travelling by local bus, train or boat.  

Of course we're not going to be able to spend as little as them as they're not sleeping in hostels or going to museums, but the more local we go, the better.

**2.  Travel Light**

Something that's often overlooked in the world of shoestring travel. Personally I think it's vital for many reasons. Most obviously not paying hold fees on airlines, but it's a lot more than that. Travelling light also allows you go wherever you want, such as chicken buses in Central America or the subway in modern cities. People travelling with huge backpacks/ suitcases are often forced to get taxis instead.

Travelling light also allows you to take advantage of the best shoestring travel method; walking!

**3. Don't Fly**

This one depends on where you are in the world, as in some places budget airlines are extremely cheap. That being said, in most areas of the world public transport is still the cheapest means of getting around, and in my opinion it's the best way to see the country.

**4.  Research**

Knowledge is power! The more you know about a destination, the easier it will be to stick to budget. Knowing where to eat and how to get around can make all the difference. Also having some idea of the prices will stop you being ripped off by those deceitful types preying on unsuspecting travellers. 

**5.  Avoid Guided Tours and Make Your Own Excursions**

Having a tour guide can be pretty useful however it's not going to help you travel cheap. What I like to do is make my own excursions. Just hire a scooter/bicycle and drive around the sites yourself. Not only is this easy on your budget, it also gives you complete freedom. A little bit of research before your DIY excursion and you're good to go. Just make sure you don't get lost (unless that's your goal). 

**6. Don't Drink Too Much**

I know, this ones harder said then done. However the biggest expenditure for most backpackers is all that drink! I'm definitely guilty of this myself, but if you can limit the drink you're going to save big. 

 **7. Cook Your Own Food**

I'm definitely not saying don't eat at local restaurants but embracing the hostel kitchen is a great way to travel cheap. Shop at the market and cook up a feast (or just cook some basic pasta from the supermarket). The more you cook the more you save, especially if you're in a more expensive country.

Keep in mind though, sometimes street food can be even cheaper than cooking yourself. It's also probably more delicious, no offence!

**8.  Travel in the Off Season**

Cheaper flights and accommodation are the main reasons to travel in the off season. Other benefits include less tourists, shorter lines and more availability.

**9.  Learn From Locals (and Other Backpackers)**

This takes us back to 'keep it local'. There's nobody that knows the place like the locals! Asking them what to do and where to eat etc is a great way to learn how to travel cheap.  You can also learn from other backpackers in hostels, which is a great way to get a conversation going. 

**10.  Travel to Cheaper Countries**

 We're not saying that it's impossible to travel Scandinavia or Japan on a budget. But it's much easier to do so in the Philippines. The easiest, and most obvious, way to travel cheap is to go to a cheap country. Duh! Despite that, I don't recommend skipping countries just because they're expensive, you've just got to be smarter.

,Shoestring,"I think most people see shoestring travel as a necessity, and if we had the money to travel a different way, we would. Personally I don't see it like that, I see shoestring travel as something that enriches my experience whilst travelling. I've made a list of reasons why I think that and I'm interested in what the rest of this subreddit thinks.

**1. You Gain A Stronger Insight Into Local Life**

Naturally, as a shoestring traveller, you have to go where the locals go. That means eating at local spots, travelling on local buses etc. That means that we will get a greater understanding to what live is really like for residents of that city/ country. More so than someone eating in tourist focused restaurants or travelling by private transport anyway.

**2. Better Food**

Of course this one depends where in the world you are. But imo, in most places the best food is to be found where the locals are. They're the ones in the know anyway. Tacos in Mexico, thali in India and spicy soups in SEA for example.

**3. It's More Adventurous**

Surely this is one of the main reasons most of us travel, adventure. Being forced to travel on a shoestring budget puts us in certain situations, that more luxurious travellers wouldn't be in, which forces us to leave our comfort zone and embrace adventure.

**4. You Can Travel For Longer**

You can either spend $1000 in 2 weeks or 2 months, it's a no brainer!

**5. It's Safer**

Okay, maybe some of you will disagree with this one. However the way I see it, dodgy characters are more likely to target those clearly with a bit of money than some frugal traveller. Thieves targeting tourists go to where the money is, not the cheap places where we will be.

**6. It's Better For The Environment**

Travelling around extensively by plane is bad for the environment, duh. As shoestring travellers we use less planes and more buses and trains. We also use less private transport like taxis.

**7. Your Money Goes Straight Into Locals Pocket**

A lot of more luxurious hotels and restaurants are ran by expats and don't benefit the locals very much. When eating in a little eatery or staying in a small guesthouse we can be sure that our money is going straight into the locals pocket.

**8. You Get To Share The Experience**

Maybe this isn't true for everyone but travelling with another person is cheaper as it allows you to split costs. That means that finding someone else to travel with you is a great idea and travelling with someone else is great. You get to share everything you experience and you have someone to relive the experience with post trip.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd be interested in seeing what you guys think about these reasons, which ones do you agree with, which do you disagree with? Is there any other reasons you would add?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. You Can Travel For Longer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can either spend $1000 in 2 weeks or 2 months, it&amp;#39;s a no brainer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. It&amp;#39;s Safer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, maybe some of you will disagree with this one. However the way I see it, dodgy characters are more likely to target those clearly with a bit of money than some frugal traveller. Thieves targeting tourists go to where the money is, not the cheap places where we will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. It&amp;#39;s Better For The Environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travelling around extensively by plane is bad for the environment, duh. As shoestring travellers we use less planes and more buses and trains. We also use less private transport like taxis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Your Money Goes Straight Into Locals Pocket&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of more luxurious hotels and restaurants are ran by expats and don&amp;#39;t benefit the locals very much. When eating in a little eatery or staying in a small guesthouse we can be sure that our money is going straight into the locals pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. You Get To Share The Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this isn&amp;#39;t true for everyone but travelling with another person is cheaper as it allows you to split costs. That means that finding someone else to travel with you is a great idea and travelling with someone else is great. You get to share everything you experience and you have someone to relive the experience with post trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d be interested in seeing what you guys think about these reasons, which ones do you agree with, which do you disagree with? Is there any other reasons you would add?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S I&amp;#39;ve wrote about this in more detail, and other things, on my new blog (theshoestringbackpackers). Feedback is appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

Im wanting to leave the country A) as a vacation and B) to meet a good pal of mine in person!

Im very excited but a bit overwelmed by the prices. Pretty young and making minimum wage so I would like some tips on frugality wherever possible but also general traveling tips I should know seeing as Ive never left my country before?

Some details: Im traveling from Canada to the UK, hopefully in May for 2+1/2 weeks, Ive budgeted myself at $5000 to account for food, lodging, plane tickets as well as ""Fun Money"" this is a high estimate and leaves me lots of wiggle room.

Im going alone for the first week and my partner will be joining me for the second just cause thats how we're doing it- it makes sense for us. So obviously some of my expenses will be lowered when he joins me and we begin splitting things but we'll just say its $5000 high.

Im personally open to staying in a hostel during my time there alone but thus far Ive only looked at Air bnbs 65-75$ a night.

When my partner joins me however we will most likely want our own space to live and breathe for a while. We re also planning to go to MCM and that means I need lots of space for cosplay stuff and the freedom to wake up at ungodly hours in a panic-

Would a hotel or a bnb be better for that in london? And would switching accommodations midway just be more expensive? (Most of the bnbs Ive looked at offer discounts for longer stays)

Some concerns/questions:

Im not sure how... money exchange works? Do I want ALL my money to be switched over to £? It cant be a good idea to carry around that much cash (even if $2000 or so will be spent already on flight/boarding)

Will my debit/credit cards work there? Im assuming debit wont and Ive only ever seen discrimination against American Express cards but thats in my country, Im guess most MasterCards/Visas work abroad? I try not to use it but it would be nice to have as an option.

If thats not the case then it'd be nice to know before Im stranded.

Ive also either heard or been misinformed that your phone might not work? Or some features? Like data? Will my data be really expensive if I use it over seas? How much should I avoid using my phone? I use discord more than I call people so Im assuming if I have wifi that will be fine.

,Shoestring,"Hello skiers of reddit,

I am a 20 year old student who has a  little more then a week off from March 13 - March 22. I have been looking at possible ski trips during that time period, but have found it really troublesome to create an efficient and relatively cheap itinerary. I am based out of NYC/Philadelphia and looking to ski in the Western United States of Canada (wouldn't mind Europe either but that price point is far out of my budget).

Anyways, I am asking you guys for any tips or recommendations on relatively inexpensive trips during those dates. I am a single traveler and expect to be ski bumming for that week, so any family-friendly recommendations need not apply. I'm willing to sacrifice luxury for price, and have no problem sticking out long layovers and late or early flights.

I have contemplated skiing at Lake Louise, but have also found a really cheap flight into Cheyenne WY. What are your recommendations for these areas, do you guys have any tips for lodging or transportation, or what other places should I be looking at in regards to an (relatively) inexpensive ski trip out west? I am an experienced traveler but have found it difficult to piece together a trip out west while keeping it in check with the budget.

Thanks for your feedback, I appreciate it.

EDIT:

I am an experienced traveler in Europe, and am used to / have no problem staying in hostels and such.

,Shoestring,"Me and my other half have been discussing Amsterdam for two nights for so long, but every time I look I just can't see it cheap enough. I paid £440 for 4 nights in a nice Riad in Marraketch in September, with flights, 20k baggage and private transfers included. And Amsterdam just seems like it will cost the same or more for only two nights!

Am I just looking in the wrong places?
How can I find a good flight deal and hotel for good price, but it has to be hotel with private bathroom not really a hostel, my man won't share bathroom.

Also I'm so confused about locations of places. Are all the weed cafes, canals, red light district and other tourist stuff what they call the centre? And if we were a few miles out is it easy to get there and back?

In the airport on our Marraketch trip a man was chatting to us saying you need about £300 a day spending money for 2 people in Amsterdam, that's not our budget. Need cheap as possible and hopefully fly from Birmingham UK.

Any advice anyone has and also good things to do too will be appreciated.

I am guessing that means that, unless something changes, I will not be allowed to board my last flight after a layover in Beijing. I **booked through Expedia 3 weeks ago (on January 20)** so ~~not getting any refunds from what I understand~~   looking in to whether I can get a refund from them after helpful advice from redditors.

**EDIT 1:** Just realized Indonesia has a ban on direct flights from China too. Fuck.

**EDIT 2/ UPDATE:** I unfortunately **did not book these flights through a credit card company** and it was booked through a debit card with no travel cancellation protection

But thanks to you all, I do now have a plan of what I can try to do:

Step 1) Contact Air China (the airlines via which I am flying both ways) to check if I can get a refund or have flights re-routed without going through China. I guess I have to be a little cautious and try to avoid countries like Japan where the number of cases are in the 100s and growing

Step 2) Contact Expedia with the same requests regarding this, since Indonesia's flight ban on direct flights from China seems to make my booked tickets invalid. It was encouraging to hear someone else having a good experience with Expedia's customer service

Step 3) Contact my travel Insurance- I have ISIC's premium travel insurance, but it's only valid till April 24th, so not sure if it will cover flights in May and August. I have to read into their fine-print of the schedule of benefits further as I couldn't find anything on this from a cursory look

**EDIT 3/ UPDATE:** I was on the phone with Expedia for a while. They said they will be in touch with Air China during their business hours and be in touch with me in 72 hours regarding whether they can give me a full refund. Air China seems to have some conflicting info on their websites, with one notice saying they will only refund flights until mid- March and another notice saying they will refund any flight to/from China booked before January 28.

I'm actively saving up now for a 27 day journey. It's my first time. I'm 31 and American from Louisiana. I've been all over Europe for the past decade but this is my first time going to Asia.

7 days in Osaka, 5 days in Tokyo, 4 days in Hiroshima, 3 days in Kobe, 3 days in Nagoya, 3 days in Okayama,

I've a good friend in Nagoya who will let me crash for a few days and a really awesome friend who's essentially my sister who lives in Osaka.

I'm trying to guage prices and all. i am seeking hostels or air bnbs for $20/night or less.

I do not mind walking a lot whether in Hiroshima or osaka. i figure in Tokyo i will def need he subway

I figured i'll use the Japan Bus Pass for the 3 day option for $100. Taking an overnight bus from Tokyo-Osaka and then Osaka-Hiroshima and finally Hiroshima-Osaka and I'll try a bullet train (once) from Osaka to Tokyo. For Osaka/Kobe/Nara i figure I can use the Kansai pass or buy cheap tix for local trains.

My friends have told me all about Yoshinoya and eating cheap foods. I'm pretty unfamiliar with Japanese food so I'm already trying a bit here and there to adapt.

I wanna hit up some museums (as a history major, I'm excited) and just visit a bunch of neighborhoods that either very foreign/American-like as well as those that tend to be quite traditional.

For the places I'm not staying with a friend in, I'm trying to find either capsules or Air BnB's or cheap hostels.

Any suggestions? Recommendations? Things I should remember?

Some general questions:

1. If we want to leave the city and travel to towns, should we aim to try to come back to the city at night? How do folks plan their accommodations if they'll be moving around towns or want to travel on a whim?
2. How do people approach transit in these locations? Should we rent a vehicle, rely on buses, or use Uber?

Also, right now our schedule looks like this below, any feedback would be great.

,Shoestring,"Hello! My girlfriend and I are planning a 'just' under 3 week road trip from Calgary to Vancouver Island within a 5 week holiday to Canada as a whole. I've got the car rental booked for exactly 21 days and basically looking for as much local knowledge or personal experience to make the best informed decisions. We are travelling August-September time.


We're both students so money isn't bottomless. Our earnings from part time jobs probably max us out at about £1500 pp for the road trip. 


Avid hikers, I want lots of good views with trails. As I saw here, I've downloaded the trails app to use!


Our plan so far is a couple of days in each of the destinations on the way, I am the only driver out of the two of us so I need lots of breaks within a max 5 hour driving a day to stay refreshed (these distances are unimaginable to my British driving experience).

The way back, we'd like a different route. My girlfriend has relations in Waterton she'd like to see but I don't know how feasible (or interesting) places are along the Canada/USA border route.

I am driving a small sedan so gas won’t be too ridiculous. Also I am very frugal (also basically broke)so I can probably get by on the bare minimum. 
Any help would be great, thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

,Shoestring,"I don't know if I got a good deal but it was $550 round trip from victoria and coming back to vancouver. I land in Cancun at 6:20pm. I am not too sure what to do from here. Does the ADO bus or something similar go into town? I don't want to get scammed by taxis. There is lots of budget hostels.. could I just show up?

I only plan on spending like 2 days in Cancun then make my way south and stopping along the way and end up at Chetumal stay for a few days then head down to belize for a week. Head back up to Bacalar stay for a few days then bus to Merida hopefully I can rent a place for a month then head to Valladolid for a few days and make my return to Cancun then depart. 

That is the route I would like to base my adventure on. 

If you guys can fill me in on cool things I can do along the way that would be awesome. I will be roughing it in my hammock on and off to save costs from hosteling. I am packing minimally and will be living out of a 40L backpack that I will bring as a carry on along with my fanny pack :) 


-------------------------------------------------------------


EDIT: awesome advice guys thanks so much.

A few questions.

Some times I won't be sleeping in hostels and just hammocking out on the beach hidden or in the woods. Where are places to shower/rinse off within these towns?

How much is alcohol like a 6 pack and a bottle of tequila? will it be too expensive at the airport?

and if I wanted to buy a cheap bicycle. How much would that be and where would I get one?

when I get to the airport I might want to get a phone plan+data how much? and get I get it at the airport?

In Canada. I like to hunt, forage, and fish. Can I do that there? What are the edible plants? How is crabbing?

I will also look into wwoofing and xhelp.

,Shoestring,"Would love some honeymoon ideas!  I've been doing some research, but I am so overwhelmed by the options.  I've looked at Guatemala, Peru, Mexico, Panama, Belize, Columbia, Costa Rica... Whew!  How do I narrow it down?

**Details:** Planning for sometime between Dec 20th and Jan 15th of next winter, for 10-14 days.  We'll be flying from the US.  Budget is somewhat TBD - we're overall frugal people, but this is also our honeymoon, and we have time to save money for a splurge here and there!  We have some flight miles to cash in, which should amount to over $1200 by the time we use them.  Would love to spend no more than $3000 beyond that.  We're comfortable in Airbnbs, but have never used them outside the US.  Neither of us are super experienced with international travel, either.  

We don't want to just plop down on a beach the whole time.  But we also don't want to be running around from city to city.  Having 2-3 spots that are a 'home base' during the trip would be perfect, as would spending a few days exploring some cities and then a few days in a more secluded nature/beach location.  

**Wish List** (we don't necessarily need all of this, but just to give you an idea of what we like):

* Delicious and inexpensive local food.
* Time near the water (either a lake or the ocean).
* Nature, history, and culture!  I'm a sucker for natural and ancient wonders. 
* A few days of peace and quiet, whether that's in a forest on the beach, or in a sleepy town.  We don't want to spend 100% of our time in cities. 
* Options for hiking and day trips in the great outdoors.

,Shoestring,"I (26M, single, American) was planning on spending a year in Thailand, Vietnam and Bali on $1200 USD per month or less. This coronavirus has me rethinking SE Asia for now. I'm thinking maybe I'll spend 6 months elsewhere and then see what the virus situation is. 

My criteria for a place has been: 
-$1200 per month or less
-Somewhere I can surf a few times a week
-Decent internet
-Decent healthcare
-Low chance of being murdered,  kidnapped, or mugged

I may be willing to drop the surfing requirement for somewhere really nice (moderate to warm temperatures, beautiful hiking areas, nice river or lake etc.)

So far I have looked at certain places in Latin America (Chile, Peru, Argentina, Mexico) and European places such as Spain/Portugal, Greece/Croatia/Romania etc. , and Turkey.

I am most drawn to Greece and the surrounding countries. I have seen a few websites claiming these places to be affordable but I have also heard much of the opposite. 

Latin America fits much of my criteria but the safety level concerns me. It seems like ""you have to know where to go"". Which I don't. 

Turkey also fits much of the criteria, but I know nothing of the safety level. I know it borders Iraq and Syria. And I am an obvious American. I don't imagine us being too popular there....

,Shoestring,"I have compiled a list of how to travel for cheap/free using tips I've picked up in my 8 years of travel and tips from fellow broke travelers. Please comment your own tips! Excuse my weak English. Most of these are for Europe travel but can apply to anywhere.

1. Travel to places when their currencies are down. For instance, the British Pound dropped by about 30% after Brexit was announced so the country was basically 30% off for foreigners. This means you get 30% more pounds when exchanging dollars to pounds while hotels, restaurants etc. have prices that remain constant. However, some businesses will raise their prices if massive inflation occurs. This is how I was able to stay in hostels for $3/night, hotels for $10/night and eat full meals for $1 in Ukraine in 2014 (right after the revolution). Currently Argentina’s economy is down - you could get 9 Argentinian pesos per dollar exchanged in 2017 and 60 today.
2. Once you make friends in a hostel, you can all get a AirBNB together which I find is often cheaper than a hostel. Keep in mind there are cleaning fees that will add on to your total price.
3. Couchsurfing. Make sure you read their reviews before staying with someone. I’ve had mostly good experiences but a few sketchy ones. As a rule of thumb, if someone exclusively has reviews from only one gender, there’s a fair chance they’re going to hit on you which can get sticky since you’re alone in their house. I put that I am engaged (which is true) in my profile so people don’t get pissy if I turn down their advances. Remember to bring a small gift for the host! A nice bar of chocolate is always a good option, bonus points if it’s a gift from a country you just came from.
4. Take advantage of public parks. In my younger years I used to stay up all night in bars and sleep either on a hammock or scarf/towel in a park. I’ve never felt unsafe or been hassled for loitering especially in huge parks like Vondelpark in Amsterdam or Englischer Gardens in Munich. Use a travel cube as a pillow and scarf/towel to lay on if you don’t have room for a hammock. Put shades and earphones in and people are less likely to bother you.
5. Trains - A lot of countries have cheap night trains. Depending on how much you want to spend, you can get a bed on a train for way less than a hostel/hotel. I remember getting a bed on a 10 hour train ride from Odessa to Lviv, I think it cost $9.
6. Eurail - Best deal ever. You can have unlimited travel 10 out of 30 days for about 200 Euros. This includes night trains so you can save on hotels. I used to take a train in the morning to one town, spend the day sightseeing, and hop on a night train to another country right before midnight and it all counted as one day of travel. Fellow travelers reported using pencils and erasable pens on their tickets to travel every day, but this is against the rules so I can’t recommend. I did the math and the trains I was taking would have cost me over $100/day while the pass was $25/day at the time. Chose 2nd class and under 27 years old for 25% off, it looks like the current price is $284 [https://www.eurail.com/en/eurail-passes/global-pass](https://www.eurail.com/en/eurail-passes/global-pass)
7. Avoid vendors that do not have prices listed, otherwise the seller will try to overcharge you if you look like a foreigner.
8. Eastern Europe - Generally, the further East you go the more affordable everything is. Places like Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, and Transnistria, are off the beaten path so they aren’t too touristy. As I mentioned previously, I got hostels for $3/night, hotels for $10/night and eat full meals for $1 in Ukraine in 2014. My friends were buying packs of smokes for 50 cents. Museums were like a dollar and the famous opera in Kyiv was $4. If you’re in Kyiv, make a trip to Chernobyl. My tour was $90 with student discount but lasted all day plus meals and only 6 others on my trip so well worth it.
9. Handwash your underoos in a sink with travel soap (concentrated soap tablets or strips). Handsoap is also fine.
10. Bring a small padlock and travel towel to avoid paying to rent one at a hostel. A lightweight scarf can work as a towel as well as many other things like a blanket, shawl, etc.
11. Travel sized dry shampoo works wonders on days when you don’t have an opportunity to shower, like when you’re sleeping on trains or parks. Bring a travel washcloths so you can take a hobo “shower” in bathrooms - scrub your pits and bits and put on deodorant and you will smell fine! Solid shampoo and conditioner in an Altoids tin take up way less space than liquid, Lush makes some good ones.
12. Free things to do - Always google free things in whatever city you’re in. My travel companions and I loved to go exploring abandoned places like an old Soviet mental hospital in the hills above Zagreb, Croatia. PS if you go to Zagreb stay in this hostel at the train station that is an old train! It was $10/night in 2017 and the owner is the sweetest old man. Most cities have free walking tours but you should tip a few Euros. Most museums in Great Britain are free.
13. Be savvy about scams. A local in a bar in Prague told us all his friends died in the Chech revolution, so we bought him beers. The next day our tour guide told us it was called the Velvet Revolution because no one died! Beers were only 25 cents in Prague so it was more funny than anything. Most beggars in Europe are actually not homeless, they just make more money begging than an actual job, don’t waste your money. If you want to donate, give them food, fake beggars will refuse the food and ask for money since they aren’t really in need. There’s a documentary on Youtube where a reporter follows some “beggars” back to their huge house, don’t get scammed.
14. The cheapest way to eat is to buy some bread, meat, and cheese from a grocery store and make your own sandwich.
15. Carpooling- In Europe there is a website called BlaBlaCar where you pay very little ride in someone's car from city to city. This is a good option if you aren't down with hitchhiking.
16. Foreign SIM cards - Monthly phone plans in Europe are super cheap. I got unlimited calls, text and 5 GBs of data in Scotland for $10/month and the plans work in the entirety of Europe (the same plan cost me $50 in USA). I find I need a wireless data plan to navigate cities, but there is an alternate way to navigate without cellular data plan or where you don't have cell service. Download this app called HereWeGo and download whatever countries you need and it works just like Google Maps but offline!
17. A good backpack makes a world of difference. If your back is killing you, you won't feel like doing anything fun. This is one item you should not cheap out on, but there are tricks to getting a nice, supportive backpack for cheap. Check your local craigslist for backpacks - I was able to get a new 40L Osprey Fairview (the woman's versions of of the Farpoint) for $45!  Keep it under 40L so you it will fit under your plane seat and you can avoid baggage fees. A good rule of thumb is to keep your pack weight under 20% of your weight, so I try to keep it under 20 pounds for me. If you are a woman or have a small frame, consider getting a woman's backpack - the straps are situated closer to the middle of your chest and they won't pull back on your shoulder bones.
18. Other posters have commented about planes for traveling between European cities - I've seen budget flights like Ryanair have deals from $15 including fees! This can be cheaper than train travel as long as your backpack is small enough to avoid baggage fees.",t2_5ltya7h3,False,,0,False,Shoestring tips from a shoestring veteran - how to travel Europe for free/cheap.

Museums were like a dollar and the famous opera in Kyiv was $4. If you’re in Kyiv, make a trip to Chernobyl. My tour was $90 with student discount but lasted all day plus meals and only 6 others on my trip so well worth it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handwash your underoos in a sink with travel soap (concentrated soap tablets or strips). Handsoap is also fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring a small padlock and travel towel to avoid paying to rent one at a hostel. A lightweight scarf can work as a towel as well as many other things like a blanket, shawl, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Travel sized dry shampoo works wonders on days when you don’t have an opportunity to shower, like when you’re sleeping on trains or parks. Bring a travel washcloths so you can take a hobo “shower” in bathrooms - scrub your pits and bits and put on deodorant and you will smell fine! Solid shampoo and conditioner in an Altoids tin take up way less space than liquid, Lush makes some good ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free things to do - Always google free things in whatever city you’re in. My travel companions and I loved to go exploring abandoned places like an old Soviet mental hospital in the hills above Zagreb, Croatia. PS if you go to Zagreb stay in this hostel at the train station that is an old train! It was $10/night in 2017 and the owner is the sweetest old man. Most cities have free walking tours but you should tip a few Euros. Most museums in Great Britain are free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be savvy about scams. A local in a bar in Prague told us all his friends died in the Chech revolution, so we bought him beers. The next day our tour guide told us it was called the Velvet Revolution because no one died! Beers were only 25 cents in Prague so it was more funny than anything. Most beggars in Europe are actually not homeless, they just make more money begging than an actual job, don’t waste your money. If you want to donate, give them food, fake beggars will refuse the food and ask for money since they aren’t really in need. There’s a documentary on Youtube where a reporter follows some “beggars” back to their huge house, don’t get scammed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cheapest way to eat is to buy some bread, meat, and cheese from a grocery store and make your own sandwich.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carpooling- In Europe there is a website called BlaBlaCar where you pay very little ride in someone&amp;#39;s car from city to city. This is a good option if you aren&amp;#39;t down with hitchhiking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foreign SIM cards - Monthly phone plans in Europe are super cheap. I got unlimited calls, text and 5 GBs of data in Scotland for $10/month and the plans work in the entirety of Europe (the same plan cost me $50 in USA). I find I need a wireless data plan to navigate cities, but there is an alternate way to navigate without cellular data plan or where you don&amp;#39;t have cell service. Download this app called HereWeGo and download whatever countries you need and it works just like Google Maps but offline!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good backpack makes a world of difference. If your back is killing you, you won&amp;#39;t feel like doing anything fun. This is one item you should not cheap out on, but there are tricks to getting a nice, supportive backpack for cheap. Check your local craigslist for backpacks - I was able to get a new 40L Osprey Fairview (the woman&amp;#39;s versions of of the Farpoint) for $45!  Keep it under 40L so you it will fit under your plane seat and you can avoid baggage fees. A good rule of thumb is to keep your pack weight under 20% of your weight, so I try to keep it under 20 pounds for me. If you are a woman or have a small frame, consider getting a woman&amp;#39;s backpack - the straps are situated closer to the middle of your chest and they won&amp;#39;t pull back on your shoulder bones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other posters have commented about planes for traveling between European cities - I&amp;#39;ve seen budget flights like Ryanair have deals from $15 including fees! This can be cheaper than train travel as long as your backpack is small enough to avoid baggage fees.&lt;/li&gt;

,Shoestring,"I decided to make a guideline to Erasmus+ Youth Exchanges and Training Courses after a question about this in r/travel.

**What are these free trips?**

Youth exchanges and training courses are usually 9 day trips to another European country, with all costs (transport, accommodation and food, and sometimes visa if needed) covered by the EU. It's part of the Erasmus programme, which includes EU countries and some partner countries (ie Turkey, Armenia, Moldova, Macedonia).Each project has a theme. The training courses are hardcore workshops, the youth exchanges are usually just an excuse to drink and contain a couple of day trips (there's also workshops on youth exchanges but fewer and less serious). It's usually 7 days with a program plus 1 arrival and 1 departure day, and you can prolong the trip with up to 2 days.

&amp;#x200B;

**How to get on a trip**

You need to find an NGO in your home country that does these trips. The trips are organised by 1 local organisation and then another 4-5 NGOs from other countries participate. You need to live in the country of one of these NGOs to participate. Many of these NGOs participate in several exchanges per year.Finding an NGO can be hard. Try using Google or check out the list below. If you get stuck, you can check out old projects and see which NGOs have participated in the past as they are likely to also have future projects. Some organisations will only let members participate, others struggle to find enough participants.Most NGOs post about their projects on their websites and/or social media. There might also be Facebook groups for Erasmus projects in your country.If you find a project you want to join, just contact the NGO, give them your info and explain why you're interested in going.

**What's the catch?**

Finding the NGOs and projects can be a pain in the ass.You have to be a resident in one of the participating countries and 16-30 y/o to qualify. Some projects have stricter demographic requirements.You have to travel to/from your country of residency (and provide proof of transport). You can stay an extra 2 days in the country in total, before or after the trip or one day before and after. You have to pay your own food and accommodation on these days though.You sometimes have to pay a participation fee, usually 20-50 euro. You also have to buy your own booze.

Let me know if you have any questions.

**Fly to Hurghada International Airport, not Cairo.** It's closer, and might be cheaper since it's a less common destination?  It's about 700 LE per night for double occupancy, including double breakfast -- **that works out to about 40 Euros per night including breakfast for 2 people (so only 20 Euros each).** The price might have increased, with the crazy inflation Egypt has suffered in the last few years, but that was accurate as of 2018.

The owner's name is Mahmoud Bawaki, and you can book 1-2 weeks in advance, so it doesn't have to be ages ahead of time if off-season. **Mahmoud's number for booking is +20 100 6443112** (but, google maps has +20 127 227 3449, so maybe he changed numbers since I was there)**.** No way to book online, which may be a draw-back, but it keeps the place unspoiled and affordable. Super private beach where you are totally alone for as far the eye can see. There's some fantastic pictures on trip advisor: [https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Hotel\_Review-g297551-d1473341-Reviews-Bawaki\_Beach\_Hotel-Nuweiba\_South\_Sinai\_Red\_Sea\_and\_Sinai.html](https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Hotel_Review-g297551-d1473341-Reviews-Bawaki_Beach_Hotel-Nuweiba_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html)

Some reviews on trip advisor are bad, but I think this is because people went expecting a normal hotel experience, and didn't get it. Bawaki is more like camping on the beach with air conditioned private huts / private bathrooms / food included.

It's extremely desolate / sparse -- you've got A/C in your hut, so and that was good enough for me! Bring your own towels, soaps, toilet paper. This is why it's cheap -- there isn't room service or much amenities. You're paying to sit on a beautiful isolated beach all day, and nothing else. **Since it's so desolate, you can request to eat ""all inclusively"", but you better not be picky eaters if going that route**. It isn't a ""dining"" experience, just the owner frying eggs for breakfast and pasta for lunches/dinners. He might have 2-3 options depending on the time of year. I had a problem with the limited menu. In my experience though, he's pretty friendly, so if you chat him up a bit he'd let you in the kitchen to do your own thing too, if you wanted to bring some supplies yourself (or go fishing right in front of your hut!). Could also build a campfire on the beach, although finding driftwood might be a challenge (can be bought in town).

**It's a resort/hotel comprised of individual huts right on the beach, with a larger communal hut** that serves as the restaurant / kitchen (no kitchen facilities in your private huts). There is no traffic of any kind, something impossible to avoid in resort towns and most beach areas. I only saw 1 or 2 cars in the 2 weeks I was there. You can even arrange with the owner for someone to come and pick you up from the Hurghada int. airport (for a fee, 45min drive maybe?). There is literally nothing else there except his cluster of huts that he rents out. There is some other resorts a drive away, that have restaurants you can visit, and a small village where you can buy simple staples like bread, but nothing within walking distance or eyesight. Really is the middle of nowhere.

,Shoestring,"Hello all,

I am quitting my job at the of this month (Feb 2020).

I have 6 months available and would like to travel across South America.

I love the outdoors, architecture, fitness, and people.

&amp;#x200B;

You have always been so helpful in my travels so I thought I'd turn to you yet again..

&amp;#x200B;

This summer I want to go on a camping trip somewhere amazing. My initial plans were to do a road / hiking trip in the Lofoten Islands for a week or so, but it looks like the flights there from London, plus the hire car and general expenses make the trip just too expensive for me at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

My dream is to go somewhere where I can wild camp and wake up to stunning mountains and dramatic coastlines. I spent some of last summer along the North West Scottish coast and adored it, and now I'm looking for something along similar lines.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any recommendations? My first thought was southern Scandinavia still (because of their relaxed views on wild camping), but I'm worried that it'll still be too expensive and the landscape won't be as dramatic as further north. Has anyone had any similar experience here or elsewhere? Perhaps the Dolomites or Alps? 

I'll be travelling from London in August/September time.

My wife and I are looking to go to Ireland and Scotland for 2 weeks in June. 
The flights are taken care of, we will be going round-trip into Dublin. 

Ideally we would like to spend about 7-9 nights in Ireland. We will be renting a car and we would like to hit all the major spots, such as
Northern Ireland- Belfast, Giants Causeway
Galway
Cork
Dingle Peninsula
Cliffs of Moher
Blarney Castle
Dublin (Guinness and Jameson)

We then plan to fly out of Dublin to Scotland (Edinburgh) and spend 2-4 days there, flying back into Dublin (1 night) and then back to the USA. 

It sounds pretty packed, but wondering on suggestions as to route and must see things.

,Shoestring,"We are traveling from Minnesota USA to Barcelona at the end of February! It will be my first time in Spain and my partner’s second visit. Our Itinerary: Fly into Barcelona, spend the day there and stay the night. Fly to Grenada and spend 5 days there, fly back to Barcelona and spend 4 more days in the city, fly home. We chose to fly within Spain because we found flights were drastically cheaper than trains for the same route. We figured the cost of an Airbnb room cost as much as a hostel (20/person/night) and allowed us to stay in a queen sized bed together like we wanted (most hostels we looked at charge extra for a double bed). We chose to spend more time in Grenada because of the free tapas to help our food budget stretch further. 

A little bit of budget breakdown so far for 2 people (USD):
Round trip flight (off season): $280/per person. 
Airbnb stays (9 nights): $375 (around $40/night...spending the night at the airport our last night because our flight leaves at 6am)
Flights between Grenada &amp; Barcelona: $80 round trip per person

Total: around $1100 for 2 people for 10 days. 

*Advice we’re still seeking:*

- Best affordable restaurants in Barcelona? I want to stay away from super touristy places for the most part.
- Best bars in Barcelona for weekday nights (we usually prefer cheap dive bars, but anything unique and worth a splurge is also appreciated!)
- Is the Alhambra night experience worthwhile or is spending most of a day there enough?
- Can you pack lunches for the Alhambra if you plan on spending the whole day there?
- I thrift a lot and love vintage clothing. Are there estate sales / yard sales / cheap thrift stores in Spain?
- If you were to “splurge” on one experience in Barcelona or Granada what would it be? 
- I don’t know any Spanish. My partner knows some but isn’t fluent. Will this be a huge disadvantage?

I’m looking to do some solo travel around Europe this year, in the coming months actually. This will be my first time doing this and I’m looking for some advice regarding whether or not I have enough money. Here’s my rough plan:

I’m from the UK and I want to fly to Vienna, then get the train from there to Ljubljana, then to Zagreb then to Split. I really want to fit Venice in somehow as well, but conscious of how expensive it is there.

My main priority is to travel between each place by train, as I love European trains. I don’t mind staying in hostels and eating whatever (really not fussed about restaurants). I’m planning on doing this trip over 1.5-2 weeks.. with the longest time spent in Split.

I got into an STA store, and get a quote. I look up the same flights myself, get it cheaper, take it back to them...and it's taking them a day to let me know what they're going to do about it.  


I thought that going through a student travel agency would mean the following:  
a) the process would save time and money  
b) they're experts who can beat me on price every time  
c) they'll be offering up suggestions as to where to go and what to do in gaps in my itinerary  
eg: japan for 60 days, gap of around 20 days, then shengen area of europe.

I&amp;#39;ve called STA 3 times, got 3 people: was told to email an around the world expert - turns out he&amp;#39;s in japan. The other two I emailed my plans, they said they&amp;#39;d get back to me... *crickets*.&lt;br/&gt;
I got into an STA store, and get a quote. I look up the same flights myself, get it cheaper, take it back to them...and it&amp;#39;s taking them a day to let me know what they&amp;#39;re going to do about it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought that going through a student travel agency would mean the following:&lt;br/&gt;
a) the process would save time and money&lt;br/&gt;
b) they&amp;#39;re experts who can beat me on price every time&lt;br/&gt;
c) they&amp;#39;ll be offering up suggestions as to where to go and what to do in gaps in my itinerary&lt;br/&gt;
eg: japan for 60 days, gap of around 20 days, then shengen area of europe.  &lt;/p&gt;

Basically I have about 70,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards Points and I can’t figure out what the heck to use them for. 

I’m looking at tickets from Da Nang Vietnam to Tokyo in April (Visa run type situation). On Google flights I found RT, non stop tickets for $200. 

When I go through the Chase travel portal the cheapest RT tickets I can find are $600, or 100k points. What the fuck? I guess that’s reasonable to some people but why would I pay $600 when I could pay $200 for the same tickets? But I’ve had these points just sitting for months because I can’t find any good way to use them. I rather just buy the $200 tickets with my own money than “waste” the points I have. But they’re kind of being wasted right now because I’m not using them lol. 

I looked it up and the Chase points I have are supposed to be worth about $800 towards travel. I much rather use that $800 to buy 4 different $200 RT tickets than ONE stupidly expensive RT ticket. But HOW?

,Shoestring,"Hi there!

So, I plan to live on Koh Rong for a month or two.

I already spent one month there, so I have some idea already.

I have a tent, sleeping bag and a place to stay for free.

What I don't have is a gas stove. I plan to buy one in the capital, and to buy some dry materials there as well, such as noodles, dry milk and others. What are the best thing to buy and do you know good cheap shops?

I really want it to be as cheap as possible, but also I want to eat healthy and balanced.

Also, any tips on the island, I would appreciate.

I spent my time on the 4k beach last time and I will start from there as well, but I really want to explore more. I don't want to give any money for shelter, so could you recommend nice locations, where I can open up my tent?

I want to prepare perfectly this time. As to minimum budget, supplies, etc...

Update: So, thanks to reddit's combined wisdom, I hatched up a plan.

Koh Rong, start from my old place and venture out in hope of finding a nice quite place for myself to meditate in peace and quite and have my personal yoga retreat. As said, I already have my tent and my sleeping bag, so this is awesome. I will need the following gear and know-how.

For survival:

1. Gas stove
2. Pot and a set of fancy tea cups for a tea party (you never know, I might get customers :D Koh Rong is very crazy)
3. Fishing rod and learn how to fish
4. Beans, rice, noodles, dry milk, coffee, tea, musli and chicken stock
5. The usual, vodka, weed and other drugs. Weed is easy and very accessible on the island, so I really don't need to re-stock on that. Vodka, definitely in the capital, it's 5 dollars for a liter and on the island it's 10 dollars for 750, so yeah. Also, drugs, no need. There is a pharmacy in the village. Also, I have PTSD, man. Don't judge. I would be all fancy drunk and get wine, but that is very expensive. If I make it till the end of April in one piece and saved up some cash, I will open a bottle of fine wine.

For self-defense:

1. Knife and a belt for a leg or something. That can be always be with me. Also, great for cooking
2. Best option, get a surf/boat no one uses on the beach an keep it at a near distance. This will cost additional services, so it's a trade-off, depends on the deal.
3. Swimming. Keep in good shape. There are few people who can outswim me, and if they are after me, I am fucked either way.
4. Jogging, whatever makes me faster. Stab and run, pretty much. I hope I don't have to, though.
5. Befriend the dogs. Best alarm. You befriend the dogs, you have protection. Now, very few people will start fighting a pack of dogs, now would they. Nope, they will just walk away from the barking.

,Shoestring,"Meant to be a longer trip but being cut short due to some family issues. I did manage to put together a *not super in depth* budget thus far.

I dont have many *EXACT* figures but I did round up for what I posted. I realize the figures I posted dont add up to the final figure listed, I didnt include emergency visa/attractions/miscellaneous things. But the final figure is in fact just under $3600

The trip was as follows: **USA-Poland-Russia-Armenia-Nagorno Karabakh-Russia-Uzbekistan-Hungary-Bosnia-Montenegro-Albania-Kosovo-Finland-Russia-Vietnam-Thailand-Malaysia-Philippines-Thailand-China-USA**

**Flights:** *around* $1500. Due to some unforseen problems (volcanoes not being the least of them) I missed a few flights and was unable to get refunded. I pride myself on finding cheap flights, had everything gone according to plan this number would have been much lower.

**Accommodation:** *around* $220. As usual, I did a lot of couchsurfing and working some jobs that included a bed. When I did pay for accommodation, I was averaging $4 hostels.

**Food:** average $2.50 per meal. Food is on the bottom of the list for me when it comes to important things, I eat for nourishment not necessarily for pleasure.

I'll go through some of the countries that have something worth mentioning, budget wise

**Poland:** This was my cheapest destination. I spent one month in Gdansk working 10 hours per week in a hostel that supplied me with 3 meals as well as a bed. I was casually seeing someone here as well who enjoyed cooking and spoiling me. I spent exactly $27 for the month I was there!

**Armenia/Nagorno Karabakh:** $80 roundtrip flight from Russia, my partner from Russia joined me to hitch hike all over these 2 countries and couchsurf along the way. $1.50 got a decent sized meal.

**Bosnia:** Through a friend of a friend, I found work as a white water rafting guide here. Shared staff quarters and food included. Only thing I spent money on was sweets when I'd go into town.

**Albania:** Worked in a hostel here by the beach for just over a month, bed and breakfast included. Averaged $2.50 per meal on my own.

**Philippines:** Missed flights due to my partners illness, then again from her passport going missing, then from the volcano. Spent 2 weeks on an isolated beach. Bungalow was $10 for both of us, dont eat breakfast so lunch was $0.60 fresh fish and rice, dinner $2.50 for different dishes and various sweets throughout the day were about $2.00 per day

**China:** Have a good friend there who invited me out and takes care of everything :)

Very basic and not super detailed, I know, but I usually dont keep such close track of this stuff. Couchsurfing, hitchhiking, working/volunteering, &amp; having good friends helps keep the budget down for sure. I realize this style isnt for everyone, but if you have any questions, I'll do my best to answer.

**EDIT:** This caused quite the stir of negativity in another sub. All this is for is to  shed some light on how to do things ULTRA cheaply. Having been active on Couchsurfing for over a decade as a host and guest, I have made friends all over the place that I could contact whenever I come to their neck of the woods. Having said that, the ONLY place on this trip where I went that I had a friend was China, and that was for less than a week. Everything else was completely spontaneous.

,Shoestring,"Hi there, I'm planning a huge north america trip next summer. It's going to be my first time there so I really want to make the most of it. The plan is to spend a few days in LA and SF, then head up to Alaska for an epic \~3 week road trip and finish with 4-5 days in New York. The ""problem"" is that I have 2 weeks more to spend before uni starts.

So I figured why not explore NA some more and head up the east coast. This area has always been intruiging to me.

What I like to do while traveling is:

* Hiking
* Photography (usually landscapes)
* Eating local food and drinking local (craft) beer
* Exploring local history and culture, the native and norse/colonial stuff in that region is especially interesting to me.

The trip should last 7-14 days and would happen in late september. It's 1-3 people, depending on if I can convince my friends to continue with me, but I'm also fine with doing it alone

I'd love to hear some experiences and pointers from that area, it's huge and I'm a bit lost where exactly to go, keeping the budget in mind because that trip is already a bit on the expensive side for me. I've no problem with (car) camping and cooking myself for most days, this saves a lot of money.

Is it at all possible to travel there without a rental car? I'm able to drive, but since I'm 21 it's tends to be very expensive to rent.

Thanks for every response!

EDIT: Just want to add: logistics-wise everything is possible: flying somewhere and back from NYC, flying somewhere and straight back to europe from there, rental car from e.g. Boston and bring it back there, one-way rental,...

,Shoestring,"Hi Solotravel!

I am planning a lifetime of a backpacking trip to Central &amp; South America. **I plan to travel for 8-9 months** so I can have enough time in each country. I would like to get an inquiry of how much I should budget for. I'm Canadian, **so I think between $8-10K CAD should work**, but any specific numbers would help a lot.

**My background**

I am a 26 year old Canadian who has travelled to 16 countries. I love travel photography, so I really travel to capture visuals. Since I am backpacking for so long with no income, I would want to stay at hostels and meet people. From my past experience traveling solo, I travelled fast. For example, **I visited Colombia within 2 weeks** and did a loop around the country within that time. Or another time where I went to Mexico and spent a month, starting from Mexico City, to Puerto Vallarta, then all the way down to Chiapas then to Yucatan peninsula **- all within a month.**

**Low Cost Solutions**

My plan is to take as many busses as possible, and not eat out as much. I would try to stay at hostels that have free breakfast, keep my meals under $5-10, and splurge on activities that are worth the time (such as the Inca hiking trail).

I do plan to buy a SIM card in each country, but I wonder if its smarter to get a WIFI device instead to save money?

For partying and drinking, I will limit that to save some costs (I have Asian genes anyway so I won't be able to tolerate much drinking).

**High Costs**

* VISA Costs
* Currency conversions (to combat this I will use a cash back card with lack of foreign exchange fees for withdrawals)
* Travel expenses such as flights, bus, ferries
* Accommodation expenses - will stay at hostels
* Time - to combat this, I will go with the flow and see how each country is like. I may have estimated the time for each country, but **I am flexible to staying shorter or longer.**
* Vaccinations - this would cost me roughly $300-600 depending on the shots I get. I would do this in my home country
* Travel insurance - $300-400 - what travel insurance would you recommend?
* Galapagos Islands - 1 week
* Patagonia - 1 week
* Amazons - 1 week

**When Would I Travel?**

Also do note I would start my journey around November 2020 or December 2020 if anything gets delayed. **I am flexible to start my journey in January 2021 if costs of flights will be expensive (especially Cuba).**

**Here is my rough itinerary:**

|November 2020|Guatemala - 2 weeks||
|:-|:-|:-|
||Belize - 1 week||
|December 2020|Cuba - 2 weeks|will require flights to Cuba|
||Nicaragua - 1 week|will require flights to Nicaragua|
||||
|January 2021|Costa Rica - 1-2weeks||
||Panama - 1 week||
||Ecuador - 3 weeks|Will also visit Galapagos Islands for 1 week|
|Mid-February 2021|Peru - 3 weeks|Peru is one of my must visit countries so I will spend more time here|
|March 2021|Brazil - 4-6 weeks|Brazil is one of the major countries I am excited for. But I'm also aware its a lot more expensive than other countries, especially when it comes to visiting the Amazons.|
|Late April 2021|Chile - 2 weeks||
|May 2021|Argentina - 2 weeks||
|June 2021|Patagonia (Chile/Argentina) - 1 week|This concerns me for budgeting as I know Patagonia can add up. I've been to the Canadian Rockies and spent a week there. Roughly I spent about $2K CAD in this area. I'm aware Canada is a lot more expensive than Chile/Argentina - so how much would this cost if I spend a week to two weeks in this area?|

**Here are things I will not tolerate with low budget travel:**

* NO hitchhiking (unless if necessary)
* NO sleeping in tents/camping (unless if necessary)
* Missing out on cultural/nature activities

**Conclusion**

Overall, what are the costs I should be looking out for? I want to travel on a low budget and make the most out of it from this trip. I sound crazy for planning ahead!

,Shoestring,"I am an American currently living in France. I have to return to the U.S. in August for a few weeks (3-ish) to get a new visa before returning to France.

I haven't travelled much inside the U.S. though I travel internationally often being based in Paris. Budget is fairly tight, around $2000/2 people for 3-ish weeks (bf is coming for about 2 weeks of the trip). This doesn't include the flight though.

We both want to try to see more of my country while I have the opportunity to. After this year I may not return to the U.S. for a few years except to visit family in Michigan and Hawaii. I really want to try to get the most out of this and see a new place. I love Paris but it is very grey and hectic and I need a break from that.

The caveat is I must be near a major city that has a visa center (VFS Services) for the beginning and end of the trip in order to pick up my visa. Cities include LA, Miami, Seattle, New York, Atlanta, Houston, Chicago (been many times), D.C. (also have been many times). 

I would prefer a sunny, warm place with swimable beaches and a fun/laid back/chill culture. The exception is New York because I have always wanted to go/my brother lives there. Bf has been already though. He also loves swimming and diving so anywhere with diving would be great (he earns a little more than me so can afford this, haha). 

The most appealing options to me are:

New York (makes the most sense financially as we can stay with my brother for part of the trip and flights from Paris are usually reasonable). Possible day or 2 days trips nearby. It doesn't fulfill the outdoorsy sunny beachy aspect but is better financially in some respects.

Southern California (fly in and out of LA, again reasonable flights, visit San Diego to see distant family and could possibly crash with them, see other towns and national parks).

Miami/possible trip to Florida Keys/southern Florida beaches/Everglades (flights are decent, meets the sunshine bill, definitely more expensive though. But it's my preferred option).

We plan on renting a car for part of the trip when necessary cus 'Merica ; we would prefer to bike or use public transport when we can. We are good with hostels/Airbnb as long as there is a private room and plan on cooking/picnics often. 

We enjoy swimming, hiking, biking, city sightseeing/vinyl store exploration, snorkeling/diving, a good local food scene, good nightlife (but not necessarily super clubby, more good bars and music) and chill people.

,Shoestring,"Hey friends, just found this subreddit and am hoping you fine people would be able to answer some questions for me.

For context, my soon to be wife and I are planning on a 16 day trip through Europe for our honeymoon. Marriage is on 6/6/2020 and we’ll be leaving shortly afterward. Departing from Kansas City! 

Vacation is booked through Costco and we’re looking to see if flights can be found any cheaper.

We have airline miles from several different cards saved up, and we’re looking for the best way to get to Europe without having to be crammed in coach/economy for 15 hours.

My questions are as follows:

1. Anyone have an airline they swear by for Business/First Class seats? Upgrades, amenities, w/e

2. Do you guys find the “above economy” seats worth it?

3. Are the Costco flights competitively priced or do they gouge you? We keep finding flights where either case is true.

4. Any other angles we should look at?

My best friend, boyfriend and I are planning to go Italy in June. We’re just about to buy our tickets which will be around/under $800 round trip. Unfortunately multi-city and one way options are like super expensive (bc I guess lots of people like to do the multi city thing in Italy), so we’re flying from Toronto to Venice, and leaving from there as well. I’m planning to have it be an 11-day trip, with 10 days in Italy (bc of travel time on the plane and whatnot). I’ve read that Italy is nicer in June; less crowds, not as blazing hot, etc. 

I was hoping to get some tips! Where to go, what to do, etc., and flight suggestions if anybody has them. I also don’t want to go to touristy places with menus in English and shit, I really want to soak up the culture. 

We’re going from Venice to Florence to Rome to Naples. We’re planning to stay in Airbnb’s but after a shitty encounter in Dublin, we’re 100% getting the place to ourselves. I’ve also read that rail italia is the best way to go but to not buy a Eurail pass.

So I'm looking for a one-way from **Seoul to Oslo** ideally from Sunday June 7th 2020 - Tuesday June 9th 2020 time period. Can't really do any dates before or after.

At the moment got my eye on June 9th @ 1pm for a duration of 14hr 5m. I don't want the longer travel time option.

Atm, Sunday 7th and Tuesday 9th have the best prices ($678.17 CAD) for the shorter leg.

My q is, it is almost five months away which is a while. Should I book or wait? Will they go up? Who knows? I have been monitoring these prices for a month or so and they haven't changed.

,Shoestring,"Hello!

Backstory:
I'm a pretty experienced traveler in Europe--in toto I've probably spent ~18 months over there, but I've never been to Spain!


As I am going to Grenada for a conference next month, I thought I would take the rest of the week to travel! 

I will be in Spain for about a week. I planned to mostly stay in hostels and to travel around by train, but the places I want to go and the whole mess of various trains and price ranges got really quickly out of my price range--I'm a grad student. 

I looked into renting a car and that seemed affordable! (I have a valid international driving permit). 

I am not amazing at driving stick, but there were a lot of reasonable automatic cars for hiring, so I think that seems to be the best. I understand I'll pay more in gas but my main question is

**What is it like parking in Andalusian cities (Grenada, Cordoba, Seville)??**

Do I try to find parking in the cities (my spanish is truly awful), pay for parking outside of a city? Pay for parking near my hostels?

My rough iternary is:  Roughly:

* 2/15: Land in Madrid, hang out, go to hostel
* 2/16: **Get car?? Take Train??** to Grenada
* 2/17 2/18: Conference, post conference trip to the Allhambra

We are looking for recommendations as to that second location. I understand that flights/trains around Europe can be quite cost efficient. 


Our first thoughts have been of Greece, specifically Santorini or somewhere similar. A decent BnB there seems to run around $100/night, with lots to do and see for free (beaches, walking, sight seeing). 


Is there somewhere you would recommend as a less expensive alternative? Is Greece a good idea? Is there a more effective way to pick this alternative location? 


Out travel experience is quite limited. I'm the more well-traveled of the two of us, and I have been to Mexico on two family vacations, and the UK as an adult, planning my way through Scotland by train to hike and camp. We have never been to central, eastern, or southern Europe. 


I have access to quite a lot of money (was VERY frugal with my student loans) but would like to keep this 5-7 day extension to under $3000 CAD if possible. I don't know it that's realistic. The costs to account for are transportation from Budapest to the second location, accommodation and food, limited activities, and transportation back to somewhere in mainland Europe where we will likely be flying home from (tickets are not secured yet so this location additionally is flexible).

My partner and I are planning a trip to India and Nepal starting in late November. We're looking at going for 8-10 weeks.

We predominantly stay in private rooms at hostels or if they're too expensive we will go into a dorm.

I am a lurker on here. I recently found a killer deal to fly to Chicago for $315 for the hubbs and I. I started looking at car rental because we are seeing family all over Chicago, and an Uber would be too expensive. When we were there last time, we got a car rental for $150 for 4 days (some amount of time we will be there for) I was thinking the rentals would be around there. But the cheapest I am finding it is $250. 

So I found an Avis that is just outside the airport that had the same cars for $120 less! I had always heard the car rental places at the airport are significantly higher, but never really looked. Has anyone run into an issue where they have taken an Uber/Lyft from the airport (or O’Hare specifically) to a car rental place outside the airport and had any issues?

Overall I'm happy with the amount spent. If we were to do it again we wouldn't fly so much, but due to meeting family and going places quickly (we wanted to go to the Bolivian Salt Flats while there was water on them) we paid for flights that we shouldn't have. That also caused us to spend $300+ on visas for Chile where we only spent 3 days. Next year we are focusing on limiting our travel to places on a whim and instead getting there slowly/cheaper.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$86 AUD per day ($59 USD)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I&amp;#39;m happy with the amount spent. If we were to do it again we wouldn&amp;#39;t fly so much, but due to meeting family and going places quickly (we wanted to go to the Bolivian Salt Flats while there was water on them) we paid for flights that we shouldn&amp;#39;t have. That also caused us to spend $300+ on visas for Chile where we only spent 3 days. Next year we are focusing on limiting our travel to places on a whim and instead getting there slowly/cheaper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

Give me your flights in something like this format the more specific the better. Please COPY and EDIT the below format :)

\* Origin: ex. NYC (JFK, EWR, LGA)

\* DEST: ex. Miami/FLL

\* Departure Dates: ex. 7/1 or 7/1-&gt;7/20

\* Return Dates: ex. 7/1 or 7/1-&gt;7/20. IF One-way just say NA

\* LENGTH: ex. 4 days (If you say 1 week please say 7 days or 7-8 days ect.)

\* Other: ex No Layovers over 4 hours.

\* Expected Budget: \~$120 (optional, Just want to see if I can get below this goal)

\* Bags: Carry-On (Goes in the overhead bin)? Personal Item (fits under the seat in front of you)? Checked Bag? This actually matters in the difference in price alot. EX. 1 carry-on, no checked bags.

Again, PLEASE be as specific and as unambiguous as possible. ie 7/15-&gt;7/30  or +/- 1 day is better than ""Late July"" or ""flexible"".

First reddit post here.

I am taking my dad to New York for the first time and I am having some trouble looking for affordable hotels. Trying to keep it below $100 a night. I know low but not impossible. Overall the budget for a 6 night hotel stay is about $650. I don't mind AirBnb options, but we are trying to look at hotel options first. He feels a bit more comfortable in a hotel.  He wants to go to all the touristy areas but I would like to  know if the community has any hidden gems that we should visit (from sights to food). 

Also if the hotel is close to a subway system that would be a huge plus. We are trying to visit all the places via subway.

We travel out January 26 and come back February 2nd

I saw the 3day pass for $100 and I'm def gonna use that.

I'm heading to Tokyo, Nara, Nagoya, Osaka, Kobe and Hiroshima.

1st use would be Tokyo to Osaka. 2nd use would be Osaka to Hiroshima. 3rd use would be Hiroshima to Osaka.

Nara/Nagoya/Kobe I can visit from Osaka for real cheap train tickets.

And I can use the bullet train when I leave Osaka for Tokyo. Might as well get one experience of it before I go.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve found you can possibly book a flight to Philippines but not fly to Philippines and stay in Taipei on the layover and possibly use another ticket back home but ... The costs increase to $900... Is there a way to negate that?&lt;/p&gt;

I know Canada is meant to be expensive, but does anyone have any advice on experience Canada on the cheap. 

The plan is to start in Montreal where I have a WorkAway opportunity lined up, so that's free accommodation, then fly to Calgary to spend a couple of days there and a couple in Banff before travelling to Vancouver. Although I don't intend to stay in Vancouver, there are WorkAway opportunities on Vancouver Island that I would like to try. 

Wanting to travel for 6 - 8 weeks, with most of them as WorkAway arrangements to cover accommodation. But with 3 - 4 weeks in hostels/AirBnBs. Two of those weeks I'll be with a friend so we can split the cost of an airbnb.

\- See kermode/spirit bears  
\- See any big ol' wild bear

I was fortunate to get the last week of March off of work, and I'd love to plan a trip anywhere in the world, but that week is one of the most expensive weeks to go anywhere. I'm flying out of PDX.

I am being reasonable?

The only tours I plan on buying will be for Ciudad Perdida in Santa Marta Colombia, Baños and Isla Plata in Ecuador and the sand dunes in Huacachinga, Peru.

As for my travel style:


- Data sim card optional but most likely will be buying one

- I speak spanish and I have no issue asking for a lower price

-Staying in hostels, dorms

-Making my own breakfast and maybe another meal of the day, buying snacks/fruit at the supermarket

-Walking or taking public transportation

-Thinking of buying a water bottle with a filter to save buying bottled water

-Taking intercity buses and maybe if its cheap a budget airline for long distance (taking only a 30L backpack under 10kg, so most likely no baggage fee)

-I do enjoy drinking and partying, but no need for fancy venues

-No drugs

-Washing my clothes in a dry bag

-Not interested in Machu Picchu

-No need of buying souvenirs

-My credit card will cover my travel insurance for the first 30 days of the trip

&lt;p&gt;i am quite frugal and like camping - so i thougth of renting a space on a campinground.. cause thats insanely cheap if you rent for a year or a whole season. but its only good if you have your own van or car .. living in a tent more than a few weeks is going to suck...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;another idea was something like wwoof or workaway - cause i am quite interested in farming and sustainability - there i could learn someting, have room and board - and (should) enough time for my own stuff... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;do you have other ideas / places where it would be possible to leave cheap,simple and save?&lt;/p&gt;

Tokyo, Nagoya, Nara, Osaka, Kobe and Hiroshima are the places I am planning to visit.

I've a really good friend in Osaka who says I can stay a week in Osaka and I have a pal who will let me crash for 2 days in Nagoya. So, I'm looking for reasonably priced Air B n B's in the other cities for around $20/night.

I finished my History degree last month and I'm eager to explore a few museums along the way like the samurai museum in Tokyo. I also wanna experience the Robot Restaurant even though the price is incredibly high ($72 or so).

The situation with transporation confuses me. I see that the JR Pass is good for 7/14/21 days. So, I'm just thinking if it's really useful as I planning to go from Narita Airport to Osaka, then Osaka to Nara, Nara to Osaka, Osaka to Kobe, Kobe to Hiroshima, Hiroshima to Osaka, Osaka to Nagoya, Nagoya to Tokyo.

I don't mind walking a lot while in places like Nara or Nagoya or Hiroshima. I imagine in Tokyo, it'd probably be impossible to just walk everywhere so I look forward to enjoying the subway there as well as in Osaka.

My friends keep recommending Yoshinoya as it's incredibly cheap. I've had it once in the US and liked it. I'm not familiar with Japanese food other than that one experience so I do wanna try new things as well.

what might you recommend i bring with me? I'm traveling on a budget for sure. I was thinking $1500 might be good (including the price of the 21 day Pass if I go for it).",t2_118z14a9,False,,0,False,Traveling to Japan for the very first time in May for 27 days .

,Shoestring,"Spontaneously booked a one way ticket to Thailand from SFO for this past Dec 7th for a month-ish long travel.

Got the flight for $350 the day before, dumbly expecting I would find and plan a flight back at no more than 20-30% more if I was flexible, once I figured out a rough return date.

A week ago I realized there's a huge premium ($1.1k cheapest) for the week or two following New Year's.



Do I have any play here besides 1) waiting the premium out in Thailand and paying the 30 day overstay fee, 2) waiting out the premium in a different country, and 3) forking over the large premium?

Perhaps some combination of airports to fly out of, or some kind of last minute plane booking strategy?  This might sound crazy particularly for international flights, but perhaps just camping out at the airport and trying to buy seats minutes/hours in advance at a discount (is that a thing?!)?


Relatively new to travel so not sure what's realistic or if any niche tips could be valuable here.

,Shoestring,"I had already made a post about this here a while ago but some plans changed and I have new questions. I'm doing a german course in Berlin this february, my dad is paying for everything and I hate spending his money so I plan on spending as less as I can. I'll separate in topics to make answearing easier. 

1- **Arrival:** I bought my plane tickets for Frankfurt as that would be cheaper, but now I need to buy bus or train tickets to arrive in Berlin. Some friends told me to look on Omio, but it showed some Blablabus tickets for as cheap as 1 euro for that trip and it seems too cheap to be real. Is there some sort of scam or is that a real price? If so, is Omio safe to buy tickets from or should I buy them somewhere else? 

2- **Touring:** what are the best/unmissable places to visit there? Museums, sights, parks, what are your recommendations? The course takes only half of the day so I have the other half free to roam around, plus weekends, so I hope to see a lot. Also, seeing the Neuschwanstein castle is kind of a dream of mine, is it worth it taking a bus there overnight, spending the day and leaving at night or I should look for a place to sleep to spend another day there?

3- **Packing:** I've never been traveling for more than 15 days and this time I'll stay away for 35, so I have no idea how to pack for that, any tips are appreciated. Since it's still winter and I'm used to tropical weather I'll need a lot of layers and that will probably mean I'll need at least one checked bag, but if it's possible not to take one I'd like to know how. It's also important to ask: is it easy to find sulphate free shampoo for curly hair in Germany? If not I'll also have to take my own shampoo.

4- **Eating:** I'll stay with some relatives while in Berlin so it's not such a big concern but I still want to help them with groceries and of course I'll eat out eventually, so what are the best places for cheap food? Is there any grocery store in particular that's cheaper? Any restaurant or cafe that has good deals? 

5- **Leaving:** After the course I'll still have 6 days before coming back to Brazil, so I thought of visiting my cousin in Paris (free time+free bed is a great way to see another city) but I'm not sure of the logistics. Going straight from Paris to Frankfurt and then home would make more sense, but if I do take the checked bag mentioned before it could make flying way more expensive, so would taking a train be a good option? Or flying Berlin-Paris-Berlin with no bags and then taking a bus to Frankfurt be better?

6- **Random Tips:** I'm a 21yo female and I've never traveled alone, and never been to Europe, so any advice on safety or any advice at all is really welcome. 

Sorry for the long post, I'm confused and excited. Please let me know if any question is unclear.",t2_in96zqy,False,,0,False,"One month in Berlin, looking for tips!",[],r/Shoestring,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_ehg1ez,False,dark,0.67,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1577703465.0,text,6,,,text,self.Shoestring,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had already made a post about this here a while ago but some plans changed and I have new questions. I&amp;#39;m doing a german course in Berlin this february, my dad is paying for everything and I hate spending his money so I plan on spending as less as I can. I&amp;#39;ll separate in topics to make answearing easier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1- &lt;strong&gt;Arrival:&lt;/strong&gt; I bought my plane tickets for Frankfurt as that would be cheaper, but now I need to buy bus or train tickets to arrive in Berlin. Some friends told me to look on Omio, but it showed some Blablabus tickets for as cheap as 1 euro for that trip and it seems too cheap to be real. Is there some sort of scam or is that a real price? If so, is Omio safe to buy tickets from or should I buy them somewhere else? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2- &lt;strong&gt;Touring:&lt;/strong&gt; what are the best/unmissable places to visit there? Museums, sights, parks, what are your recommendations? The course takes only half of the day so I have the other half free to roam around, plus weekends, so I hope to see a lot. Also, seeing the Neuschwanstein castle is kind of a dream of mine, is it worth it taking a bus there overnight, spending the day and leaving at night or I should look for a place to sleep to spend another day there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3- &lt;strong&gt;Packing:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;ve never been traveling for more than 15 days and this time I&amp;#39;ll stay away for 35, so I have no idea how to pack for that, any tips are appreciated. Since it&amp;#39;s still winter and I&amp;#39;m used to tropical weather I&amp;#39;ll need a lot of layers and that will probably mean I&amp;#39;ll need at least one checked bag, but if it&amp;#39;s possible not to take one I&amp;#39;d like to know how. It&amp;#39;s also important to ask: is it easy to find sulphate free shampoo for curly hair in Germany? If not I&amp;#39;ll also have to take my own shampoo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4- &lt;strong&gt;Eating:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;ll stay with some relatives while in Berlin so it&amp;#39;s not such a big concern but I still want to help them with groceries and of course I&amp;#39;ll eat out eventually, so what are the best places for cheap food?

Give me your flights in something like this format the more specific the better. Please COPY and EDIT the below format :)

\* Origin: ex. NYC (JFK, EWR, LGA)

\* DEST: ex. Miami/FLL

\* Departure Dates: ex. 7/1 or 7/1-&gt;7/20

\* Return Dates: ex. 7/1 or 7/1-&gt;7/20. IF One-way just say NA

\* LENGTH: ex. 4 days (If you say 1 week please say 7 days or 7-8 days ect.)

\* Other: ex No Layovers over 4 hours.

\* Expected Budget: \~$120 (optional, Just want to see if I can get below this goal)

\* Bags: Carry-On (Goes in the overhead bin)? Personal Item (fits under the seat in front of you)? Checked Bag? This actually matters in the difference in price alot. EX. 1 carry-on, no checked bags.

Again, PLEASE be as specific and as unambiguous as possible. ie 7/15-&gt;7/30  or +/- 1 day is better than ""Late July"" or ""flexible"".

My lease is up on March 1st, and new lease begins a couple weeks after that. Since I have no place to go, I thought about just taking a trip somewhere! Anyone know of any last minute vacation packages or flights to anywhere?

Places visited:

-Eastern Canada/USA 
- Istanbul, Turkey 
- Rome, Italy 
- Amsterdam 
- Eastern China (Major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, and smaller cities in between)
- Mongolia 
- Paris, France
- Reykjavik, Iceland 
- Zurich, Switzerland 
- Belgrade, Serbia
- Morocco (Fes, Marrakech, Chefcaouen, Ouarzazate, Rabat, Casablanca, Erfoud, Sahara)
- Mexico (Guadalajara, Mexico City)
- Peru (Lima, Ollantaytambo, Cusco, Aguas Calientes)


Looking to explore something new, but safe! Open to anything other than Mexico. Doesn’t have to be out of America, but would I’d be open to any suggestions!

Budget:

Really anything under $1200 for flights/accommodations. I can usually find cheap flights anywhere, so more of how expensive the cost of living is there.

&lt;p&gt;My lease is up on March 1st, and new lease begins a couple weeks after that. Since I have no place to go, I thought about just taking a trip somewhere! Anyone know of any last minute vacation packages or flights to anywhere?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Places visited:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Eastern Canada/USA 
- Istanbul, Turkey 
- Rome, Italy 
- Amsterdam 
- Eastern China (Major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, and smaller cities in between)
- Mongolia 
- Paris, France
- Reykjavik, Iceland 
- Zurich, Switzerland 
- Belgrade, Serbia
- Morocco (Fes, Marrakech, Chefcaouen, Ouarzazate, Rabat, Casablanca, Erfoud, Sahara)
- Mexico (Guadalajara, Mexico City)
- Peru (Lima, Ollantaytambo, Cusco, Aguas Calientes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking to explore something new, but safe! Open to anything other than Mexico. Doesn’t have to be out of America, but would I’d be open to any suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Budget:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really anything under $1200 for flights/accommodations. I can usually find cheap flights anywhere, so more of how expensive the cost of living is there. I would like to avoid something that’s as expensive as Iceland. I usually stay in hostels too, so that will bring prices down.&lt;/p&gt;

,Shoestring,"Hi /r/Shoestring!

I've been working on a new free app called [CardPointers](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cardpointers/id1472875808) for the last year to help me, my family, my friends, and now the entire internet to travel for free/cheap by maximizing the rewards offered by banks on purchases every day.

I'm sure that most of you already know about the huge sign-up bonuses for credit cards, and how to translate those points into free/super cheap flights, hotel stays, and even cash back, but there are \*tons\* of points left on the table every day when you don't use the best credit card in your wallet to get the most points back for your purchases. Not to mention all of the perks that each card has that most people just forget about... the app that I built tries to make the whole process as easy and automated as possible, with a focus on privacy.

Here's the quick feature list as of right now:

* Over 3,000 cards in the database.
* No banking information collected, just use Sign in with Apple (and you can easily hide your email address), then add your cards by name with instant-search.
* 16 different bonus categories, with more coming soon.
* Select any category, and every one of your cards is ranked from highest to lowest-earning (points bonus \* value).
* You can customize every card's point value based on your personal preferences.
* Tap on any card to get the full breakdown of all of the benefits; you can also track your approval date, whether you met the minimum spend already, call customer service with one tap, and of course check if the card has foreign fees or not (because who likes wasting \~3% when we're trying to save money!)
* The app has a bunch of iOS 13 native features including Siri Shortcuts integration, full voiceover support, dark mode, Spotlight search integration, and lots more. Here's a [blog post](https://medium.com/@emcro/getting-started-with-siri-shortcuts-in-cardpointers-518fca86367) that covers some of the shortcuts that I've built so far.
* User-selectable categories, for cards like the Cash+, Cash Rewards, BRG, and more was just submitted to the App Store yesterday and should be live this weekend; if you really can't wait for that feature, you can join the [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/1fC4LqND) for early access (and hopefully no bugs :)
* If you're an Android user or just don't like mobile apps, you can also use the [web version](https://getcardpointers.com/), though the iOS one gets all of the new features first... so you might get jealous (fair warning).

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know what I can improve to make this tool even more valuable for the community, and of course if you run across any issues. If you can't find a card that you already have or find an error in the earnings, please shoot me a PM (or use the Report a Problem link at the bottom of every card page) and I will update the database quickly.

Thanks for checking it out, and hope you have a great holiday and earn even more points in 2020!

&lt;li&gt;User-selectable categories, for cards like the Cash+, Cash Rewards, BRG, and more was just submitted to the App Store yesterday and should be live this weekend; if you really can&amp;#39;t wait for that feature, you can join the &lt;a href=""https://testflight.apple.com/join/1fC4LqND""&gt;TestFlight&lt;/a&gt; for early access (and hopefully no bugs :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;#39;re an Android user or just don&amp;#39;t like mobile apps, you can also use the &lt;a href=""https://getcardpointers.com/""&gt;web version&lt;/a&gt;, though the iOS one gets all of the new features first... so you might get jealous (fair warning).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please let me know what I can improve to make this tool even more valuable for the community, and of course if you run across any issues. If you can&amp;#39;t find a card that you already have or find an error in the earnings, please shoot me a PM (or use the Report a Problem link at the bottom of every card page) and I will update the database quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for checking it out, and hope you have a great holiday and earn even more points in 2020!&lt;/p&gt;

,Shoestring,"Hey r/Shoestring, I'm the guy that [posted this the other day](https://redd.it/eaxwu7), and was honestly overwhelmed by the response. Absolutely thrilled that so many of you got some benefit out of it. I got a fair few questions on budgeting, how much I spent, and South East Asia specifically. I've got a basic budget in this post that might be helpful to some of you, I'll individually send this thread to the people who asked a couple days ago too. But anyway, here's how I see SE Asia costs.

Before I get into the details, here's what the finished product looks like, this is how much it costs to do SE Asia (*as an example*):

## Typical Total Cost Breakdown: Variable Cost + Fixed Cost Spread for SE Asia

|**Variable costs**|**Price per week (USD)**|
|:-|:-|
|Hostels|$53|
|Food + Water|$112|
|Entertainment + Drinks|$67|
|Inner City Transport|$35|
|Fixed cost spread|$175|
|**Total Variable Cost**|**$266**|
|**Total (Variable + Fixed)**|**$441**|

Also before diving into the explanation, some quick currency conversion help, and if you want pie charts with breakdown data and more info, you can go [to the article page](https://thriftybackpacker.co/how-much-does-it-cost-to-travel-south-east-asia-cost-breakdown-budget/):

|**Currency**|**Weekly Variable Costs**|**Weekly Total Costs**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|USD|$266|$441|
|EUR|€239|€397|
|CAD|$351|$582|
|GBP|£200|£331|
|AUD|$388|$644|

So these prices are either expensive surprising, or cheap surprising, depending on your expectations of SE Asia. The good news is that this can all be decreased and we need to note a few things.

* This example is for a trip that's 1 month - meaning the fixed costs (like flights) only get spread out over 30 days, making it seem like we're spending a ton everyday. If it was 2 or 3 months, the daily fixed cost spread would be much smaller. (we go into fixed costs and calculations below)
* Food and entertainment is based on me, you could be very different
* This doesn't account for money being made on your trip, or other saving habits we talked about in the other thread

 **Examples:** 

* [Working in a hostel for board, food, and entertainment](http://thriftybackpacker.co/how-to-travel-the-world-for-free-the-ultimate-backpacking-guide-2/#how-to-get-cheap-or-free-accommodation-) \- In the example above you'd save all of your hostel fees and half your food &amp; entertainment - shaving off \~$140 from your weekly budget
* [Teaching English remotely](http://thriftybackpacker.co/how-to-travel-the-world-for-free-the-ultimate-backpacking-guide-2/#teaching-english-or-other-languages) \- as an example, just teaching two 1 hour lessons remotely on a contract basis would earn you \~$100

So yes you can bring this way down :)

# So now for some more details (for the brave)

**Fixed costs:** Flights in/out, visas, passport, insurance

**Variable costs:** Accommodation, food, transport, entertainment

* **Total SE Asia Budget** = Total Variable Costs + Fixed Costs
* **Weekly SE Asia Budget** = (Daily Variable Costs \* 7) + (Fixed Costs / Total Days Abroad \* 7)

I like to break down costs into *Fixed* and *Variable*. If you're looking for what everything all up is going to cost, this is the way to go about it in my opinion. I've put the full breakdown above, but if you want to know how I calculated some of the fixed costs, it's going to be below.

# Here's an example of a typical fixed cost breakdown

And yours might be different but you can adjust certain items to cater for how expensive your flights are, or how many inter-city trips you do.

|**Fixed costs**|**Price (USD)**|
|:-|:-|
|Flight In|$242|
|Flight out|$207|
|Inter-city Transport|$207|
|Insurance|$104|
|**Total**|**$759**|
|**Total per day (30 Days)**|**$25**|

The **total per day** is going to be a separate item in your variable costs, so the idea is that we're **spreading the fixed costs throughout our trip.** This helps with accounting for the fixed costs of a trip and adding it into what will be our daily and weekly cost breakdown/budget. (And that's what the 'fixed cost spread' item is in the budget.)

Note: If it was 2 months, the fixed daily cost would be $12.5 - the more you're abroad, the bigger the spread, the smaller the day price.

The flight in and out will depend on where you live, the sales available when buying your ticket, and the time of year. So change that one accordingly.

**Hot Tip:** The way I calculate Inter-city transport is by *finding several cheap, medium and high priced sample trips - and averaging them to find the average price.*

So if I'm planning on doing 4-6 inter-city trips (e.g. Bangkok to Phuket + 3 more), the price I'd include in the budget would be **4 x Average Trip Price.**

This gives me a ballpark on what to expect, but doesn't restrict the freedom by pre-booking things. In the example above, **the average I used was \~$26 (25.7)** \- I calculated the the total by assuming *8 trips in a month at \~$26, totaling $207*.

[More details on the article page.](https://thriftybackpacker.co/how-much-does-it-cost-to-travel-south-east-asia-cost-breakdown-budget/)

Also - Here's some currency conversions to help you out.

|**Currency**|**Total Fixed Costs**|**Total Per Day (30 Days)**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|USD|$759|$25|
|EUR|€683|€23|
|CAD|$1,002|$33|
|GBP|£569|£19|
|AUD|$1,108|$37|

So there you are friend, that's a simple breakdown of a typical month in SE Asia. Obviously adjust these according to your particular trip but this should give you enough information to have a better idea if you hadn't already thought about it.

Quick notes before I leave: 

* Everyone budgets differently, if you have a way that works for you, stick to it
* There are other fixed costs like vaccines and visas that I haven't included, please include them in yours as necessary
* A buffer of 10% should be a standard, just in case

And finally, I'll answer any questions and welcome any criticism below! I'm learning just like you, there's plenty of well seasoned travelers here and I'm open to tips!

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes you can bring this way down :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;So now for some more details (for the brave)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixed costs:&lt;/strong&gt; Flights in/out, visas, passport, insurance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Variable costs:&lt;/strong&gt; Accommodation, food, transport, entertainment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total SE Asia Budget&lt;/strong&gt; = Total Variable Costs + Fixed Costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekly SE Asia Budget&lt;/strong&gt; = (Daily Variable Costs * 7) + (Fixed Costs / Total Days Abroad * 7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to break down costs into &lt;em&gt;Fixed&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Variable&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Flight In&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$242&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Flight out&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$207&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Inter-city Transport&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$207&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Insurance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$104&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$759&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total per day (30 Days)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you are friend, that&amp;#39;s a simple breakdown of a typical month in SE Asia. Obviously adjust these according to your particular trip but this should give you enough information to have a better idea if you hadn&amp;#39;t already thought about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick notes before I leave: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone budgets differently, if you have a way that works for you, stick to it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are other fixed costs like vaccines and visas that I haven&amp;#39;t included, please include them in yours as necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A buffer of 10% should be a standard, just in case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, I&amp;#39;ll answer any questions and welcome any criticism below! I&amp;#39;m learning just like you, there&amp;#39;s plenty of well seasoned travelers here and I&amp;#39;m open to tips! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;

,Shoestring,"Hey r/Shoestring, 

TL;DR: Traveling to SE Asia next year for a long time, any tips/tricks/stories appreciated. Also specific questions at the end of post! 

I plan to take a trip to SE Asia with my father around Oct 2020. This trip would span for 3 weeks with him &amp; I’d probably take an extra 2 weeks to backpack around more frugally as a solo traveler. The budget for the 3 wk trip with my dad would be around $2000 &amp; my solo trip I’d try to stay under $1000 (already being there &amp; not having flight costs should help right? 

The plan would be to then find some kind of job (Teaching English/Working at a resort/Digital Work) and live in the area for all of 2021. 

I come to this sub in the conception stages of my planning &amp; I’m sure to be active during the next few months. I’d love to hear how y’all start your planning process, which cities or adventures I shouldn’t miss in SE Asia, cool places to stay, or literally any tips/experiences you want to share. 

Here are some specific questions I had: 

1. Will I hace trouble acquiring a long term visa to work? 
2. Is my budget of $2,000 for two people (1 Bed) for 3 weeks in SE Asia realistic? 
3. Which country would be better to start in? 
4. Any areas to avoid?

,Shoestring,"Hello!  
So last year I saw tickets from Chicago to Brussels during November were 290 round trip. I did not even plan at the time what I was going to do or where I was going to go, I just bounced on the first opportunity to go to Europe for dirt cheap.

I just got back from this trip where my boyfriend and I went to Berlin, Amsterdam, and Brussels which was so amazing, but I definitely did not plan the trip as well as I should have (but hey, it was my first time planning a trip to Europe and we came back alive and not entirely broke so I say it was a success) 

I'm a college student so I don't have a ton of money and time, but I'm already dying to be back over seas. I know this time even when I see a really good flight deal, I should have at least a little bit of an idea of how I want to plan the trip before booking.   
That being said, tickets from Chicago to Paris are about 270 round trip right now for May of 2020. I'm really tempted to buy, but I'm trying to conceive a relatively reasonable plan without breaking the bank or overdoing it. 

Ideally, I want to go from Paris, Barcelona, fly to Greece, then back to Paris. I know that Greece isn't the closest place to go when in France and Spain, but honestly that's the place I'm dying to go to the most. 

If I were to go for a total of 10 days, would those three destinations be reasonable? I also thought about Southern Italy which I absolutely adore but I have already been there once and although I'm dying to go back, I want to explore other parts of Europe I haven't seen quite yet before planning on going back.

,Shoestring,"Hey r/Shoestring, I wish I found this sub before I'd left but all's well that ends well. I saved a great amount, and figured out ways to extend my backpacking trip pretty much forever. This thread is for the best bits of a [blog I wrote here](https://thriftybackpacker.co/how-to-travel-the-world-for-free-the-ultimate-backpacking-guide-2/), the full blog is long and needs to have the contents page so I've left it there if you want to check it. Otherwise, these are my absolute best tips, and I'm sure others have more experience so please put your tips down in the comments! Enjoy!

* **Ditch the check-in luggage and go carry-on only.** 7kg (15.4lbs) of clothes and accessories in a 40L bag is all you need. Seriously, the ladies like to say its because I'm a guy, but I've seen plenty of female backpackers do this too.*Hot Tip:* Packing cubes are life savers, and [this Osprey Bag](https://thriftybackpacker.co/the-best-carry-on-travel-bag-for-backpackers-in-2020/) is by far the best investment I made for this trip. It has the perfect dimensions for airlines to not tear me a new one. I saved $500+ on baggage fees.
* **Get a travel card that re-reimburses ATM fees.** For Australia, ING Bank has a card that will re-reimburse all foreign ATM fees, I’ve heard of similar ones for the UK and US. In fact there was a thread on one [for the UK on this sub a few days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/ea398e/visiting_thailand_bangkok_changmai_phuket_phiphi/fank2n3/?st=k46wn345&amp;sh=ca180cd3). Because I didn’t do this, I had a nice *“$I don’t want to even calculate”* total fee at the end.
* **Use** [**Skyscanner’s**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/skyscanner-travel-deals/id415458524) **price chart to compare flights, use** [**Rome2Rio**](https://www.rome2rio.com/) **for land travel comparisons.** You can compare prices by day/month, get cheap flights to gems you didn't even know about. Don’t use travel agents if you like money.
* **Work in guesthouses/hostels and teach English for free accommodation and travel money.** These are some of the easiest ways to practically travel forever, all you have to do is ask. And if you speak English and are social, you’ve got the job. This is one of the ways you can chill in a city/town/area you like for slightly longer term. It won't make you rich but man does it offset life for the cost of 2-3 hours a day.
* **Teach English/German/French on your terms** \- There's high demand, especially in Asia for English teachers, and you can set up a job for yourself so you can work remotely usually teaching Chinese students, but you've got plenty of access to other opportunities. And no you don't need to know the other language.  [Job listing are here.](https://www.gooverseas.com/teaching-jobs-abroad)  
[I go into more tips and advice on this in this section.](https://thriftybackpacker.co/how-to-travel-the-world-for-free-the-ultimate-backpacking-guide-2/#teaching-english-or-other-languages)
* **Sign up to** [**Trusted House Sitters**](https://www.trustedhousesitters.com/) **or** [**Mind My House**](https://www.mindmyhouse.com/) \- These services let you get free accommodation by house sitting for other people. You can get to see some pretty cool places, just by sitting for people. Couchsurfing is also good for free accommodation.

I'm sure a lot of you are well versed in all of this, but these are discoveries I made for myself and thought I'd share in case it'd help with anyone's upcoming trips! Feel free to ask any questions too! Not an expert but I've learned quite a bit :)

I am only going to specific pockets in each country.

And I am flying everywhere, not a fan of overland trips. 

So fly in, spend 1 month in a loop, then fly out.

* LAOS (Luang Prabang and North) mid July-mid Aug

* VIETNAM (Hanoi and North) mid Aug-mid Sept

* CAMBODIA (Siem Reap and Battambang) mid Sep-mid Oct

* MYANMAR (Mandalay and North) mid Oct-mid Nov

,Shoestring,"For exploring a new city, nothing beats a bike. I would have liked to bring mine on the train for my next trip, but the return trip didn't offer the service. 

Has anyone rented a bike from a seller on Craigslist? I'm considering to searching the listings for a good one in my destination city, and then ask the seller if they're willing to rent it for a few days instead of selling it outright. 

For example, if their asking price is $150, I will offer them $175 or more, with an agreement to sell it back to them for $150 so they earn $25 and can sell it again. In the worst case, I will be stuck with the bike and have to abandon it when I leave. The seller will have an incentive to buy it back for the low price, which is what I'm counting on.
