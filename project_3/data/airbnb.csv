,AirBnB,"Hey y'all,

I had a $200.00 gift card that I applied to my AirBnB account. When I was scrolling through the gift card FAQ page, there was a statement saying ""when you book, the balance from any gift card funds will be automatically be applied to your account."" 

This is my first time going through the AirBnB process myself, so I went ahead and booked my stay thinking the gift card would automatically be deducted from the cost of the stay. There wasn't any box on the checkout page either saying ""use gift card funds,"" so I entered in my CC details and thought it would be fine, as per their FAQ page statement--only to find out I was charged the full cost of the stay.

I immediately opened a ticket with AirBnB through their messaging system, but they still haven't replied. I called their customer service line too, but they're only accepting calls from customers who have a stay/reservation in 72 hrs or less. I feel like I may be SOL because on their gift card TOS, it also says that gift card funds can't be applied to existing reservations and I only have until 3PM today to cancel for a full refund. 

I'm going to contact the AirBnB Twitter support page, but if I get no response soon, I was thinking of getting in touch with the AirBnB host, canceling my reservation, and rebooking. 

I have a few questions about this process. Has anyone ever gone through this before? If I cancel and rebook immediately, will I be able to secure my original dates (9/4 - 9/7)?

,AirBnB,"Hey everyone,

Just wanted to give everyone an update to my post from a month or so back:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/hwes9i/host\_asks\_for\_direct\_payment\_for\_repairs\_to\_water/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/hwes9i/host_asks_for_direct_payment_for_repairs_to_water/)

Here's what happened:

(1) We notified AirBnB of the issue.  It took them TWO WEEKS to get back to us and the person who did was not helpful.  This sub was 10x more helpful than AirBnB employees.

(2) The host kept pressuring us to pay him on Venmo,  but (leveraging your advice) we finally pushed them to the AirBnB chat window and Resolution Center.

(3) The host became enraged that we pushed him to AirBnB comms.   In the chat window he told us  that he called AirBnB and told them that he needed the place back immediately and it was approved by AirBnB.  (Apparently he can do this?)

(4) He threatened that if we did not leave by 4pm on the day he asked, he would call the police on us.  He did this in the AirBnB chat window.

(5) We reached out to AirBnB and they had no idea what he was talking about (including the Security Team who was actually responsive once they saw the police text).  No one could say for sure if he actually had requested us to leave.  No one could say for sure whether he had the right to call the police.  This was the most baffling thing.  He told us that AirBnB itself was aware of us being forced to leave, but the reps we spoke to were not willing to commit either way.

(6) They were willing to get us out of there and refund us for the remaining two weeks.  (This was helpful, but not amazing.  We had to just go home and end our stay early because there was nothing available to rebook and hotels were much more $$$).

(7) Given the threat of the police, we had to hire a U-Haul and get a bunch of packing supplies to get out in time.  (Ironically, $700).

(8) After we left, he filed a claim with AirBnB for the water payment.  We  declined to respond to his initial claim writing ""We do not want to comment at this time.""  Then he appealed to the AirBnB arbitrator and we wrote a lengthy rebuttal.

(9) His claim was very easy to rebut.  Once it was written down and not just threatened over text, it was clear that he had no real case.  He had no proof that the damage was because of us, the water system had been damaged many times before (he wrote in his claim that when he lived in the house, he himself had broken the water system **many times** and that's how he ""knew"" our son had broken it) and I had texts, photos, time stamps, showing how we had handled everything according to policy and like good guests.

(10)  We won the claim within 72 hours.

(11) We're still out $700 (for the U-Haul, etc).  I've asked AirBnB how to file a claim for that or if they would pay us about 7 times on various channels, but they've been silent about it.

(12) A tiny part of me wants to keep fighting, but I'm 99% sure that I'm just going to give up and get on with my life.   If anyone has any ideas on how to fight, please comment.  I have a friend who used to be a Chief of Police in the state where this AirBnB is and he told me to go to the Health Department or the Consumer Protections Office, but I may just move on.  All ideas are welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

LESSONS:

(1) **Always communicate through AirBnB systems and document everything.**  I was lucky I had texted everything, taken a lot of pictures and saved it, but the portal would have made it so much easier.

(2) **NEVER pay hosts through Venmo or off AirBnB** **.**  We had paid him for a few small things on Venmo early in our stay and in retrospect, I think he was trying to ""groom"" us to get comfortable with the system.  I think there are some AirBnB TOS exceptions to this, but BE CAREFUL.

(3) **Do not expect AirBnB (the company) to help you.**  They are understaffed and like many tech companies they have totally silo'ed customer service teams.  We dealt with the ""Claims"" team, the ""Security/Safety"" team, the ""Rebooking"" team and then just the general people on the chat window.  None of them had ANY idea what the others were doing or were even familiar with rules and processes.  The relationship you are in with the host is much more like the relationship you have with your landlord (if you are a renter) than if you are a guest in a hotel.   Think about how helpful your town/city government is when you have a problem with your landlord.  AirBnB is arguably more helpful than that, but not much.

(4) **Your host can force you to leave at anytime for essentially any reason????** I'm not sure if this is actually true, but AirBnB wouldn't say it wasn't true (sorry for all the negatives).  We booked a 3 month stay and had an expectation that we'd stay for 3 months.  Our host wanted us out on a random day and we had to get out in hours - in a pandemic, where there was no other availability for miles and miles.   If a landlord tries to evict you, you have a lot of rights.  If a hotel asks you to leave in the middle of your reservation, they have to seriously think about their brand.  In this case, it's one bad rating (and that bad rating can be reciprocal).

All in all, I seriously doubt I'll use AirBnB again.  I'll definitely never use them for a long stay and I probably won't use them for an important stay either.  If I do, I'll definitely use only Superhosts.

,AirBnB,"My family and I have stayed in a handful of Airbnbs and overall have had entirely positive experiences. I was shocked recently when we received a rather poor rating from our most recent Airbnb host. We rented a townhouse for a week. The host reported in her review of me, that the cleaning service they use charged them extra, because we left the Airbnb in ""unacceptable condition"" and she was ""contemplating passing the charges on.""

I sent her a text message saying I was so sorry to read this, and asked what exactly the concern was. She listed three things:

1. Trash and food left on the tables (unless I had a major brain fart I think that's blatantly untrue)

,AirBnB,"Host has admitted over airbnb platform that he left every single window open in our airbnb purposefully ""for reasons of Covid-19"".

He did this during the second biggest wildfire in California.  While there was no threat of fires in the area, the Air Quality Index at the time was 250.  (The AQI was just as bad at home too but we live in a small apartment that was at increased risk relative to the Airbnb and thought it would be nice to be able to relax with more space)

My wife is pregnant.

I contacted Airbnb immediately and requested assistance.  There was no internet or cell service and my host would only give us access to wifi in 100mb increments.  My host said Airbnb was working on alternate accommodations for us but never responded.

We pleaded with our host to put us in another house or to come by to help us but he refused.  He offered no help whatsoever outside of telling us to contact Airbnb and suggesting that we turn the fans on.

I reached out to Airbnb initially a few times an hour.  My wife couldn't stop throwing up due to the smoke.  We couldn't figure out why we couldn't clear the smoke out.  We were 5 hours from home so around 1am we decided it was best to stay the night when Airbnb still hadn't responded.

Neither one of us slept... we couldn't because of the smoke.

We realized the next morning we had left a window in the bathroom by our bedroom wide open.  It was behind a shower curtain and we simply didn't notice it because we didn't get in the shower.

There was no way we could finish our vacation so we got in the car and drove home.

Two days after our reservation began and we had initially contacted Airbnb for assistance, they finally responded.  I was initially told we'd be getting a full refund as well as a compensation package.

Communication since has been awful... maybe one sentence from Airbnb every 2 days.

Now I'm being told ""a mistake was made and the host already has the full amount of the reservation"" and that they can only offer me $150 refund.

Airbnb is choosing not to respond.  It's been 3 days.

,AirBnB,"I recently discovered the new Off-Facebook Activity page on Facebook. It contains some limited information about data that Facebook collects from third parties about your usage of their websites and other services. It appears that Facebook is able to identify that the user in question is associated with that particular third party account using various methods such as matching the name, email address, etc, sort of like what we see with online advertising networks.

I checked my data using that Off-Facebook Activity tool and I found many entries for Airbnb, a few hundred. Most of the entries for any of the services are very limited and basically look like the following:

&gt;  
&gt;**Event** CUSTOM

&gt;**Received on** July 29, 2019 at 7:15 AM

Events can also be like ""Activated App"", etc.

What I wanted to check was whether anyone knows the exact nature of this data that is being sent. In an overview of the Off-Facebook Activity tool, on their website, Facebook mentions something like ""\[...\] For example, the data collected might include the specific item that was added to the shopping cart."" This leads me to suspect that this data for Airbnb is not simply ""metadata"" but also includes ""content"". 

Specifically I would be curious if this data includes the specific listings / locations a user has stayed at, or viewed/searched on the website, and when. In other words, is Airbnb sending information to Facebook about where users are staying.

I should note that I never linked my Facebook and Airbnb accounts. The only way I can think that they made the connection is my phone number and full name, which are the same on the accounts, and the IP address that I use to login to the Facebook and Airbnb apps on my phone.

,AirBnB,"Hello all,

I’m supposed to go stay at an Air BnB this weekend with my boyfriend and his mom. His mom is 66 years old and has been wanting to get out of the house so she thought this would be a good way to get out during COVID. We plan on opening all the windows, disinfecting surfaces, and spraying Lysol throughout the home. I’m even going as far as packing our own bedding, our own cookware, utensils, plates, etc. Basically, we are bringing everything we will need to use, just really there for the change of scenery. 

However, my boyfriend and I are suddenly very nervous about going. His mom is 66, prediabetic, and is a cancer survivor. She’s very much a high risk person for COVID. We also live with his dad who has COPD and diabetes, so when we are done with our trip, we come home to him and what if we bring it home to him? 

The Air BnB is close enough to our house that we won’t have to make any stops on the way there. We have already gotten groceries from our local grocery store curbside pickup, so we won’t need to do any shopping while we are there either.

,AirBnB,"Hey

I’m so stressed out. I’m a host and a guest. As a host, I was so pleased to get a request for my place. I accepted and immediately went to book somewhere else. Foolishly, I booked in France (I’m in the UK), and then heard rumours that France was going to impose quarantine restrictions on UK visitors. After sleeping on it I wrote to the host to ask if, theoretically, he’d allow a refund if this happened and I could no longer go. I was pretty shocked when he didn’t say yes - just quoted the strict cancellation policy terms. 
I called him in a bit of a panic because I couldn’t quite believe he wouldn’t just put it through (the place is *dead* and I literally booked in the evening then slept, it’s not like months of prep had gone into it from his side).
So anyway the guy turns out to be not very nice. He was arguing with me for more than an hour on the phone and I just thought “nope” and put the phone down and rang Airbnb, because it’s frankly a bit strange how desperate he is to not refund me.
They sided with him because it’s within the cancellation terms, but I just cannot help but think he could have been decent about this and refunded it? I feel pretty stupid for trying to book international travel during a pandemic but as soon as I realised *how* stupid I tried to cancel and he was having none of it.

What do we think? I’m mega stressed as I have nowhere to go when my house is rented. This guy is so unpleasant I don’t want to go and stay in his house even if the restrictions don’t end up being implemented.

Edit: I errrr, I’ve let four people (out of four) cancel on me over the summer no questions asked, I thought it was a “thing” to be flexible because of the rona. Seems like I’ve been doing it wrong?

,AirBnB,"Hi. I'd like to start off by saying that Im posting on behalf of my fiance (a covid nurse) because she doesn't like confrontation. 

My fiance, the covid nurse, was set to take a contract in Fort Worth Texas for 30+ days.  She was supposed to start August 17th, 2020.  Prior to accepting the Forth Worth covid contract, she spent months outside of Baltimore working at a covid hospital (using AirBnB services).  After her Baltimore contract she was supposed to go right to Texas to start the next contract.  She accepted the Texas contract August 5th.  

Being from the Pittsburgh area, she needed a place to stay while working in Texas, so she booked an AirBnB for the length of her contract (30+ days).  She's not new to AirBnB.  She has used their services many times (all positive experiences).  Naturally, she was going to book her stay in Texas using AirBnB services.   

She was set to depart August 14th and drive there. Her contract was suddenly canceled August 12th, 2 days before her departure.  She notified AirBnB emediately of the change in plans. She asked for a refund due to her contract being canceled.  Reasons of which were out of her control.

After many conversations with the host and AirBnB,  she has yet to get a full refund.  To date, she has only received $500 in refund.  Both the host and AirBnB do not want to comply with giving a full refund. 

Being a Covid first responder, it is in my opinion they they should be more forgiving and issue and full refund.

I've used Airbnb only a handful of times, but this kind of blatant scam makes me hesitant to use their site at all.

She has never cancelled before so what I read is that she won&amp;#39;t be penalized. We didn&amp;#39;t want to file a claim regarding travel issues. This all needs to go down tomorrow so any insight would be appreciated. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

,AirBnB,"Hello!

I had a refund request because I was exposed to COVID, and responsible me decided I shouldn't be traveling now and to self quarantine. This meant I needed to cancel my AirBnB.

Now, I get that 50% is standard after 48 hours. I am entitled to that, as I stayed 0 nights there. In my opinion, with COVID involved, I should always be entitled to 100%, but that's my opinion (As long as your account doesnt have a history of requesting full refunds.))

Well, the host agreed that if the dates book that we originally had, we could get the full refund.

I noticed the dates were full, and so I sent the full refund request. They denied it claiming that they never received the full amount and that all of it was already refunded. 

That makes no sense. Why would AirBnB let me request a refund for the final remaining amount if there wasn't any money left?

I verified in my bank account that the only refund I have from AirBnB is for the original refund amount, not the full amount. So they definitely still have the rest of my money.

&lt;p&gt;I had a refund request because I was exposed to COVID, and responsible me decided I shouldn&amp;#39;t be traveling now and to self quarantine. This meant I needed to cancel my AirBnB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I get that 50% is standard after 48 hours. I am entitled to that, as I stayed 0 nights there. In my opinion, with COVID involved, I should always be entitled to 100%, but that&amp;#39;s my opinion (As long as your account doesnt have a history of requesting full refunds.))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the host agreed that if the dates book that we originally had, we could get the full refund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed the dates were full, and so I sent the full refund request. They denied it claiming that they never received the full amount and that all of it was already refunded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That makes no sense. Why would AirBnB let me request a refund for the final remaining amount if there wasn&amp;#39;t any money left?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I verified in my bank account that the only refund I have from AirBnB is for the original refund amount, not the full amount. So they definitely still have the rest of my money.&lt;/p&gt;

,AirBnB,"I checked out of an Airbnb. The host is out of town. He said he had his friend stop in to check the place out, and noticed damage to the floor.

I become worried when neither host responded to our initial messages. A follow-up message a week later asking for exact address received no response. When I tried to call them, there was no answer - and I noticed that the two hosts had provided the same number, which made me deeply suspicious.

Anyway 3 weeks after making the bookings, no response from either host, no response from AirBnB support - and so I made a request for the hosts to cancel the bookings. One host responded to AirBnB say that they can still host us - but still won't respond to my messages or answer any other phone calls. We have heard nothing back from the other host.

What our our options? Cancel now and cut our losses? Surely AirBnB have some obligation to make sure hosts are actually responsive to communication. Anyway any ideas, let me know

I have a few spaces and for two of them, which are mother-in-law suite type spaces, I always mention to new guests that it’s a shared space (one with myself and one with the room this lady was booking) but the smaller room, which is like 12x12 and just has a bed, tv and couple of nightstands one it never has a problem with people thinking it’s a whole home.  

Her first message was asking for my phone number. I told her she could use the app to call me, sent her click by click instructions and eventually screenshots of how to call me directly. She couldn’t figure it out.  

She arrives with her husband and immediately I understand she thought it was a whole house and not a shared house. She confirmed my suspicion when she said, “So there will be other guests here?”.   

After giving her the tour, I go back to work and about 20 minutes later, I get this message...  

*We stayed 5 minutes and left. I’m sorry but we’re not comfortable. If you feel it in your heart to refund some funds, it would be appreciated. We haven’t left any reviews yet.*  

I’m a little taken aback because I have her every opportunity to find a new place before leaving.  

When I asked why she was uncomfortable and why she didn’t say anything, she replied that “we are very OCD and the place was terrible. The dresser was filthy. The throw pillows were torn and nasty and the bathtub hasn’t been cleaned in weeks”  

None of these things were accurate so I immediately posted pictures of the dresser, nightstands, pillows and bathtub. There was a little sand in the bathtub because the other guests had just returned from the beach and rinsed off their sandals/flip flops and didn’t rinse it all out. By a little, I mean if you liked it all up, it would be about the width and height of a nickel. The dresser and night stands had been cleaned with Lysol less than 30 minutes before she arrived.  

I had already decided her initial reply would easily be considered blackmail for a refund with her review so I wasn’t worried about a negative review. I was also disinclined to offer a refund because, quite frankly, she was a bitch.  

Then she started in about a refund. Message after message and text and calls. About 18 all together. Mind you, she still hasn’t cancelled at this point so zero chance of repenting the space but I finally got fed up with her and told her she could have a full refund just to get rid of her.  

If only. I’ve gotten 12 messages since calling AirBNB **FOR HER** to initiate the refund. It’s Tuesday (this happened Friday evening) and now I’m having to explain to the old bag how fucking banks work.  

I got another message today that she still hasn’t heard back about her money and that this was crazy. I tried to reply but couldn’t get two sentences down without saying, “No bitch, you’re crazy”.  

I wasn’t going to leave a review because I felt like it might make it harder to get hers removed if she leaves one. But now I don’t really care. I just don’t want to deal with her any more and for sure want to make sure any potential future hosts understand she is the epitome of not right for this platform.

Few questions:

1. For a 3 bedroom house which can accomodate 5-8 people how much one can earn? (Given current house sizes list theirs for $150+ nightly rate)
2. Companies who take care of houses, how much commision they take to maintain , what all tasks they manage ?
3. Will it be a good idea to go for this plan given the current economy?

&lt;p&gt;Well they just informed me yesterday of another roommate joining the airbnb without consulting anyone. Do you think it would be okay for me to backout of the airbnb because of this? I was only looking for 2 roommates but there&amp;#39;s another person that&amp;#39;s sharing the bedroom with another girl. I&amp;#39;m not looking to get my money back, but I don&amp;#39;t want to live there anymore. I&amp;#39;m not on the guest list and there wasn&amp;#39;t a lease that we made. Do you think it would be appropriate of them to still ask for the 3 additional months of rent if I decide not to live there?&lt;/p&gt;

,AirBnB,"Hi, I hope someone can advise me?

I'm looking to rent an apartment for a month in a major European city. I do need a good, fast internet connection to continue my work. I'm also involved in an online course and need to do regular skype calls and screen sharing sessions, again requiring a reasonably fast connection. 

Reading through various forums and articles, the general advice is to get the host to send a screenshot of the Speedtest (by Ookla) results. This makes sense but I am confused how the host can send the Speedtest screenshot to me. As i understand it, AirBnB doesn't allow images to be sent through their communication tools and direct email communication is not recommended.

So, how does a potential guest check this information with the host?

,AirBnB,"Hi there,

Thanks for accepting me onto this forum. I've been a host on Airbnb for around a year now, and I am lucky enough to have earned Superhost status. Although I am on the border-line between being a regular host and a superhost - my current ranking is 4.83, and I know the threshold is 4.80.

I always seem to get five stars in all but one category - cleanliness - where more often than not, I've only been able to secure a grade of four. In normal terms, that is a good score, but as I'm sure all of you know, it's not great on Airbnb. However, most of the overall scores on reviews I get stand at five.

I'm just wondering if I continue to get 4/5 for cleanliness, 5/5 for other things, and four or five star overall, will my Superhost status remain secure?

It's actually a very hard thing to be able to work out.

,AirBnB,"I had a reservation to stay at an AirBnB from 8/16-8/29. 

Upon arriving to the AirBnB the friends I was staying with did not like it for a multitude of reasons I don’t want to list, but we decided to cancel on 8/18.

We were out that morning and I canceled the reservation which I didn’t think would be a problem because the hosts cancellation policy states: “cancel before 8/29 and get a full refund minus the service and cleaning fee”.

I cancelled it and had a notification on the reservation that I would receive a refund and that it was initiated. We have been staying in a new place since then.

Where the problem starts is that today the refund notification on the reservation is gone and it states the reservation is “current” as in we are still staying there. I also never got an email saying we cancelled even though I 100% did so I have no evidence really that we did cancel.

I messaged the host and asked her why it said that and she has not responded.

I spoke to a rep at AirBnB and they sent my problem to another rep who I’m waiting to hear from.

Has anyone experienced anything like this? From what I can tell the host declined my refund but how could that be possible if their cancellation policy clearly states I should get a full refund? Do you guys think we will get our money back?

so, should i tell the host? can a host decline a booking based on my recent travels?

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve noticed that I have been getting a lot of requests from people with no review and/or no picture. One actually somehow managed to instant book despite my set rules. Is this normal and would I be okay renting out to people like these?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t access my account, I have not received payouts from AirBnB for past bookings and I can&amp;#39;t access my tax documents. This is a complete nightmare. I was a superhost with over $450,000 in 5 star reviewed bookings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without warning over $55,000 in future bookings were refunded without notice and I am banned from the platform. Seriously AirBnB?&lt;/p&gt;

,AirBnB,"We(me and GF) booked an apartment for a period of a week, from last Thursday to today. Yesterday afternoon, around 16:00, we were both sleeping. I woke up to the sound of the intercom ringing. Thinking that it was just a random person trying to get into the building, I ignored it and tried to get back to sleep.

A minute later there was knocking at the door, so I got up, and while I was searching for pants, I could hear the front lock getting opened. I quickly raced to the door while it opened, and found a a guy, visibly surprised looking, apologizing while telling me he needs to take a blanket. 

I was groggy and standing there just in underwear, so I told him to wait while I get dressed, and closed the door. I put pants on, saw my girlfriend was still asleep, so I went out and asked him where the blanket is, so I'll bring it out to him. 

He insisted that he will come in and take it, as its in the bedroom, under the bed drawer. I told him my GF is asleep, so I'll get it to him and he can wait outside. He got worried and said it will be too noisy, so he'll just return tomorrow to take the blanket. He apologized again and left.

I was also confused and still in a state of waking up and I found the whole event to be surreal, wasn't even sure I wasn't imagining the whole thing. It took me a new minutes to process everything and for the anger to settle in. 

Now, I never even met the host, I had to collect the keys from a nearby kiosk, his profile picture doesn't show his face, and he stated that he lives in another country, but his GF lives nearby. For all I know, it's a former guest who copied the keys.

Checked my phone and Airbnb account, no message or anything from the host. I contacted the host, asking him if it was him, but he didn't reply until today, after I left the apartment, with the following message: [host reply](https://ibb.co/84vj09q).    
Which just made the whole situation worse

This guy had a rating of 4.8, with about 300 reviews. Everything was just as described and I have no complaints about the stay otherwise. But him entering a place like that is a breach of trust, and his excuse made it worse tenfold, am I to understand that it is something he does regularly?

I don't know if I should report or make a complaint about this, write this on the review, or just tell the host privately and let it go. Am I blowing this out of proportions? Is this something that is common place on Airbnb? Cause this is the first time I'd ever happened to me.

,AirBnB,"Hey,

I recently booked a monthly stay. I paid good money for the apartment, but after staying here for a few days, I don't particularly like the place or the host.

Two things in particular:

\- There are essential pieces of equipment like glasses missing, I mentioned this to the host, but he doesn't care

\- Today the host came to get some stuff acting weird and nervous, then later messaged me that I shouldn't have parties and that I need to take better care of the place - I kept the place very orderly and clean to my standards, and never had anything remotely resembling a party (or even any guests at all)

\- It's located in a bad neighborhood, which I realize isn't the host's fault but surely doesn't add to the appeal

Overall I don't feel very welcome here and wonder if I could shorten my stay. But the long-term booking policy seemingly prevents me from getting any refund for the first month. Is there something I can do if I don't like the place, but there wasn't any explicit violation of the contract, or am I stuck in this place for the next four weeks with no leverage whatsoever?

You kind of had to wiggle your way in. It was two story and the bottom was tile. They did the installation wrong and it wasn't level making the door hit the floor when opening. You could barely get into the laundry room as well. The space to squeeze was much smaller. It has sliding glass doors to the back downstairs and upstairs with no working locks. This condo was attached to others. Idk these people. Most of them were renting as well. I was kind of afraid for my family. I ended up cutting a tree limb on the side of the road to block the door from sliding. That might not be a big deal to some, but for my wife, children, mother in law, and myself I didn't feel safe. The hot water was scalding. One bathroom actually had a cute sign that said warning hot water that was written on the mirror, but I found out how hot it was in the kitchen by burning my hand. Obviously the thermostat on the hot water heater isn't set correctly. I wash my hands in hot water usually. When I tell you it was hot it caused burns on my hands I am treating with cream at this time. The place was supposed to have WiFi. I reached out to them about it not working. When you would connect to it, it would take to you a site asking you to activate the services for the provider like they had just gotten it. I sent a follow-up asking them to contact me about other issues and nothing. 

Now we rented this place to get away. My wife works as a practicioner at the two local hospitals. We had Covid months ago. She has been overworked. She deserved a break. We have a dog. A corgi to be exact. This place allowed pets. I want to leave a bad review. An honest review. To be honest I would like a partial refund, but I will let the money go, this is more about the principal. I'm worried this place is dangerous. We have a baby and what if our baby or our 11 year old was burned by the fire water. I want to leave the review, but I'm afraid of them leaving a negative review in return or coming up with a claim my dog did something that she didn't do and charging me the 200 pet cleanup fee that was in the agreement. Will AirBnB protect me? Will they see that is what is happening? I took videos and pictures. I have proof of this. My dog never went upstairs on the carpet unless she was in the kennel at night to sleep next to the bed. The rest of the time we blocked off the stairs. I just don't want someone getting hurt like I did or worse.

,AirBnB,"3 weeks ago, I was staying at a house that was shared by other Airbnb guests. There were a few issues with my Airbnb experience.

1. The bathroom smelled like urine. It wasn’t super dirty, but I couldn’t stand the foul odour. I had to hold my breath every time I walked in.

2. There were two other guests during my stay. One of them was constantly retching over the bathroom. I wasn’t sure whether he was sick or not. But it was definitely concerning, especially during COVID-19. The sound he made also made me uncomfortable.

3. The same guest never kept his voice down at night despite the house rule. During the two nights of my stay, he was talking on phone and playing music at 2am

,AirBnB,"I recently went to an Airbnb yesterday where check-in was at 4 PM. Upon entering, it was a complete mess.

\- A foul odor of cigarettes inside the room despite it being a ""no smoking"" place. My gf couldn't handle staying inside for too long and just waited in the car

\- There was a literal partially smoked cigarette on top of a door frame, human hairs on the bed, the entire room looks absolutely filthy. It looks like they did a quick sweep of the room, folded the bedsheets, put some towels on the bed, emptied out the trash bags/fridge, then called it a day. There were like human hairs inside the freezer and the icetray was stained with dirt. They advertised on the listing that they've done an ""enhanced cleaning"" following Airbnb's standards

\- The AC barely seems to work and it just seems deadly in this room during this heatwave. I blasted the AC on max and it didn't seem to do anything. So I left it on and just waited in the car and talked with my gf for around 45 minutes. After coming back inside the room, it was still hotter inside the room than it was outside. Right now the East Bay is hitting like 105+ degrees temps and this room has an atrocious AC and unblockable windows that make it completely uninhabitable.

\- They advertised safety amenities like a smoke detector and carbon monoxide alarm but I couldn't find either. (I scoured the entire room, but maybe it was just hidden for style purposes).

\- It's not a listing managed by a host, but a rental management company that I'll call V to not disclose information. They didn't respond to any of my messages until I called Airbnb, after which they offered to send a cleaner to spray air deodorant and look at the AC. They also claimed that they talked to the host and he said the AC was working perfectly, but the only issue was the power outage (But I was there before said outage). They only sent me messages through text and not the Airbnb website, but I don't know if this is standard or not. It really just feels like they're stalling for time right now

\- My case manager seems completely fixated on when I said the ""AC doesn't seem to work"". The AC runs, but it doesn't seem to do anything in cooling the room at all (I've specifically stated this). And I think she's basing my entire case around that, ignoring everything else (cleanliness, odors, missing safety amenities). But this might be because the host lying about doing an enhanced cleaning, the entire guesthouse smelling like cigarettes, and the missing detectors are low severity issues and the AC being atrocious is a middle/high severity issue?

It's honestly becoming a pain because I left the Airbnb after testing out the AC, simply going home. Then my case manager told me to drive all the way back to the Airbnb so I could get a video of the air conditioner, but I think there was a power outage so it was totally unresponsive. Now I'm probably going to have to drive up again this morning.

I think with a lot of effort I could make this Airbnb work (bring my own cleaning supplies and sanitize everything, air filter, stuff to get rid of cigarette smell, newer portable AC, and see if I can install a smoke/carbon monoxide detector) but it kind of defeats the purpose and it's like I'm spending a lot of money/labor to do what the host promised to do/have.

Further Edits and more info:

1. I paid for 28 days and I'm not entirely sure how quick this issue is going to be resolved. Or how it's going to be resolved, so I'm pretty damn worried. Also, this is my first stay so I'm nervous and not entirely sure if all this is standard or not for Airbnb. My gf is still complaining about her clothes and hair smelling like cigarettes from her short duration inside the room, and she's saying I should get a refund but I'm not really sure if Airbnb does that.
2. I talked to two friends and both of them told me to call the number again then ask to speak to a supervisor instead of a case manager. They said if this fails, I should call my bank and have them do a chargeback. Is this wise? I'm not really socially competent, so I'm not entirely sure I can be stern enough to demand to talk to a supervisor or even get my bank to do a chargeback.
3. Apparently they take your 500 dollar security deposit if they detect any smoke, so I'm also worried they're going to take my security deposit because I walked into the Airbnb and complained about the odor of cigarettes permeating the air.
4. I stayed at my gf's parents house for a day, but I don't think I can stay for any longer. My gf refuses to move our stuff into the Airbnb because the cigarette smell will get all over it so we're just going to be stuck outside after this

Final Edit: My first case manager seemed a little reluctant to help, but the next two people on the line were wonderful and got me a complete and total refund. It took a lot of driving and the better course of a day of nonstop messaging, calls, and video taking but it worked out.

&lt;p&gt;I think with a lot of effort I could make this Airbnb work (bring my own cleaning supplies and sanitize everything, air filter, stuff to get rid of cigarette smell, newer portable AC, and see if I can install a smoke/carbon monoxide detector) but it kind of defeats the purpose and it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m spending a lot of money/labor to do what the host promised to do/have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further Edits and more info:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I paid for 28 days and I&amp;#39;m not entirely sure how quick this issue is going to be resolved. Or how it&amp;#39;s going to be resolved, so I&amp;#39;m pretty damn worried. Also, this is my first stay so I&amp;#39;m nervous and not entirely sure if all this is standard or not for Airbnb. My gf is still complaining about her clothes and hair smelling like cigarettes from her short duration inside the room, and she&amp;#39;s saying I should get a refund but I&amp;#39;m not really sure if Airbnb does that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I talked to two friends and both of them told me to call the number again then ask to speak to a supervisor instead of a case manager. They said if this fails, I should call my bank and have them do a chargeback. Is this wise? I&amp;#39;m not really socially competent, so I&amp;#39;m not entirely sure I can be stern enough to demand to talk to a supervisor or even get my bank to do a chargeback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparently they take your 500 dollar security deposit if they detect any smoke, so I&amp;#39;m also worried they&amp;#39;re going to take my security deposit because I walked into the Airbnb and complained about the odor of cigarettes permeating the air.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I stayed at my gf&amp;#39;s parents house for a day, but I don&amp;#39;t think I can stay for any longer. My gf refuses to move our stuff into the Airbnb because the cigarette smell will get all over it so we&amp;#39;re just going to be stuck outside after this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final Edit: My first case manager seemed a little reluctant to help, but the next two people on the line were wonderful and got me a complete and total refund. It took a lot of driving and the better course of a day of nonstop messaging, calls, and video taking but it worked out. &lt;/p&gt;

,AirBnB,"Hello, 

A couple friends and I (who have all been quarantined in our two homes) are going up north for the weekend in a rented cabin via Airbnb. Here’s the issue: it’s covered in taxidermy/antlers and my friend is a vegetarian. 

Yes, we should’ve paid more attention to the tiny photos, but now we’re locked in. SO. I need help with techniques for covering/hiding/disguising these bad boys. I cannot find any solutions to hiding/covering these dead animal heads on the internet. Apparently “hiding taxidermy” and “covering taxidermy” only bring up tips and tricks for the creation of more taxidermy. Not helpful. 

Of course there’s the covering with a blanket, but that has its own level of creepiness. Since we are renting for the weekend, we can’t simply take down the taxidermy and hide it in a bedroom. Plus I think some of it is mounted very high.

,AirBnB,"Just back from a pretty weird Airbnb experience in the north of Israel.

I left my wife in charge of finding somewhere within our budget. Didn't even look at the photos but I trust her judgment.

The reviews mentioned that you have to pick up the key from a neighbor which sounded fine. What I wasn't really anticipating is that in order to access the Airbnb you had to ascend a staircase located in the woman's front yard ... or that, because they have no AC and it's incredibly hot, her family keep their front door open in the summer and like to sit topless in the living room which was immediately behind aforementioned yard.... so you need to pass them and exchange awkward pleasantries every time you come and go to the apartment. The family also seemed to be living in a pretty poverty-stricken situation and seemed to manage the apartment for somebody else as an odd job. It felt really awkward. The neighbor / key lady was doing her laundry outside in a bucket that she placed in the stairwell down from our apartment above them to the street level .. so we kept having to ask her to move it whenever we went down.

Weirdest part was last night. After coming back from dinner we found that the host had locked the main door from the inside. We had to sort of bang on the door before they heard us and apologetically came down to let us in. For three minutes, we were sure that we'd have to find somewhere else to stay that night ... which was especially problematic as our stuff was obviously in the place (and I take a couple of meds).

To top things off, the place also flat out stunk of air freshener which really affected my allergies. Thinking about complaining but we were only there for two nights and technically it was fine ... just totally weird. Oh, and there was no hot water.

,AirBnB,"Have been crying about the experience yesterday for 2 days and can't get over it. It was our third group of guests ever and I made the idiotic mistake of allowing instant book. It allowed these 3 dangerous, ghetto, aggressive people to book, who trashed our apartment in literally one hour. I had a bad feeling about them but it was a Monday afternoon and so last minute that I thought it would be OK, what are the odds. I was so wrong. These are the worst guests ever and the reason we are now banned from renting our apartment on Airbnb by our building. They caused us thousands in damages and lost future airbnb income. Also have to change all our passcodes and locks because everyone felt unsafe with their hostile behavior.

Because we are brand new to this, we have only made about $220 total from our first two listings which won't even cover the damage. I feel like such an idiot after all the lengths my husband and I went to beautify the apartment, set up toiletries and breakfast, decorate, set up the listing, etc.

Reasons:

1. Booked a same-day instant book and decided to throw a party in our apartment (which is also our home), despite the fact that parties are NOT ALLOWED, which is written all over our listing. And it's during the COVID pandemic, making this very unsafe.
2. They didn't bother to read the listing and thought this apartment (our home) was for themselves, not just one bedroom.
3. We stopped their party one hour into it and gave them a full refund just to get them ASAP to leave but they were extremely rude, refusing to leave and cursing at us! We only spoke to them in a calm and professional tone and they were very hostile. We felt very unsafe and almost called the police on them. The only reason we didn't is because the police would have taken hours to get there and we just wanted them gone ASAP.
4. They refused to leave until they saw their refund, which we gave via the Airbnb app instantly, but they wanted to see the money right now, which is impossible because it takes a few days to return to the original payment method. They refused to understand this. Airbnb support didn't respond despite 10 messages. They remained on the property for hours making a scene. This got us in trouble with the building manager, neighbors, store owners etc. We are now banned from renting out our apartment in the future and lost thousands in future business because of these terrible guests.
5. Set up all of their party decorations and moved our table cloths etc around, creating a huge mess. They left many balloons and confetti all over the place. Our floor was filthy with dirt and it took hours to clean their mess.
6. Sprayed some kind of vanilla perfume/oil all over the place and it's been almost 30 hours since they were here and the whole apartment still smells like that despite opening the windows. It got on all the furniture and ruined all our furniture in our own home where we live.
7. They stole our kitchen towels and haven't responded to any of our messages.

Airbnb is not responding about how to submit a claim for damage either for 2 days.",t2_60lqk0ww,False,,0,False,Vent: Feeling Horrible After Guests Trashed Our Home Where We Live,[],r/AirBnB,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ic8ual,False,dark,0.54,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,1597782376.0,,[],{},,True,,1597810745.0,text,6,,,text,self.AirBnB,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have been crying about the experience yesterday for 2 days and can&amp;#39;t get over it. It was our third group of guests ever and I made the idiotic mistake of allowing instant book. It allowed these 3 dangerous, ghetto, aggressive people to book, who trashed our apartment in literally one hour. I had a bad feeling about them but it was a Monday afternoon and so last minute that I thought it would be OK, what are the odds. I was so wrong. These are the worst guests ever and the reason we are now banned from renting our apartment on Airbnb by our building. They caused us thousands in damages and lost future airbnb income. Also have to change all our passcodes and locks because everyone felt unsafe with their hostile behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we are brand new to this, we have only made about $220 total from our first two listings which won&amp;#39;t even cover the damage. I feel like such an idiot after all the lengths my husband and I went to beautify the apartment, set up toiletries and breakfast, decorate, set up the listing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Booked a same-day instant book and decided to throw a party in our apartment (which is also our home), despite the fact that parties are NOT ALLOWED, which is written all over our listing. And it&amp;#39;s during the COVID pandemic, making this very unsafe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They didn&amp;#39;t bother to read the listing and thought this apartment (our home) was for themselves, not just one bedroom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We stopped their party one hour into it and gave them a full refund just to get them ASAP to leave but they were extremely rude, refusing to leave and cursing at us! We only spoke to them in a calm and professional tone and they were very hostile. We felt very unsafe and almost called the police on them. The only reason we didn&amp;#39;t is because the police would have taken hours to get there and we just wanted them gone ASAP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They refused to leave until they saw their refund, which we gave via the Airbnb app instantly, but they wanted to see the money right now, which is impossible because it takes a few days to return to the original payment method. They refused to understand this. Airbnb support didn&amp;#39;t respond despite 10 messages. They remained on the property for hours making a scene. This got us in trouble with the building manager, neighbors, store owners etc. We are now banned from renting out our apartment in the future and lost thousands in future business because of these terrible guests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up all of their party decorations and moved our table cloths etc around, creating a huge mess. They left many balloons and confetti all over the place. Our floor was filthy with dirt and it took hours to clean their mess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sprayed some kind of vanilla perfume/oil all over the place and it&amp;#39;s been almost 30 hours since they were here and the whole apartment still smells like that despite opening the windows. It got on all the furniture and ruined all our furniture in our own home where we live.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They stole our kitchen towels and haven&amp;#39;t responded to any of our messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope these people are banned from Airbnb as no well-intentioned host like ourselves should go through the hell these people put us through. We have lost a source of income now hated by our neighbors/building, and our apartment was trashed.&lt;/p&gt;

,AirBnB,"Hi,

new host here. Probably the worst time ever to start this business... but better times will (hopefully) come

I've already got two inquiries from guests who would like to book my place for more than a month. (instant booking is available only for less than a month)

I had a short chat with both guests and then they decided not to book the apartment because it was too expensive for them (although they saw the heavily discounted rate for the requested month already) and for one of them I made a better offer - still too expensive. To end the conversation with my potential guests I then declined both inquiries because of ""other reasons"" and wrote a short, friendly message.

My question now is if it is bad for the airbnb algorithm when you cancel the inquiry from a guest (Even in my case, in which I would have liked to have taken in both guests, however, it turned out in the course of the conversation that their budget was far too low). Or should i have just accepted the inquiry and let reject the offer by them?

,AirBnB,"I had a guest book Thursday to Saturday checkout 2 weeks ago. That left my prime money night left unbooked. If you booked Saturday the earliest you could checkout is Monday and not many people book like that.

So I jacked up the price of a 1-nighter from $300 to $700 and I had 8 zero review guests, almost all accounts that were made this month or last month that wanted to book just that one night.

4. How much interaction with guests do you have? Think this can be done remotely and through a virtual assistant?

But the host will barely budge on price even for somebody with years of only excellent reviews from hosts. Why would a host choose to have no guests at all rather than lower their price upon request for guests staying for an entire week or longer? How can they pay the mortgages or even just the tax bill on all those apartments with zero to two nights booked a month?&lt;/p&gt;

,AirBnB,"So, I get a first-timer guest, 3 18-year-olds. About 15 mins after checking-in they send 3 photos.

1. a slightly tarnished fork (not dirty but tanished)
2. a small bit of sand by the corner of the sofa (It's a beach town)
3. Exactly 2 crumbs caught in the sink strainer.

Guest: This is not acceptable. We paid a cleaning fee and we want it back.

Property Manager: Sorry about that. The place was cleaned but we must have missed that.

Guest then calls to berate the property manager and then has her mother (not a guest) call and explain that there could be Covid there and demands the place be re-cleaned.

I inform guest we will refund their cleaning fee and finally; they stop yelling at the property manager.

,AirBnB,"Update: I finally get refund after several days. It wasn’t a very pleasant experience to get denied and find new place to live within a day (I am lucky that I sorted it out quickly). Although Airbnb is not very fast in these matter, I am always able to get the full refund.


Previous post:
So my host wants to cancel the 14-day reservation begin from tomorrow because she does not trust me to stay (I asked if I can send my SIM card to her address so she probably think I am a scammer because of that. I understand).

But she does not officially do the cancellation immediately. So I tried to use the Airbnb cancellation - cancel by host function to send her a message (it did not show any differences in the conversation and I wonder if it is a bug?). She then replied to me with offers of alternation from 14 days to 1 day and asked me to accept it. OFC I did not do that.

Now I am waiting for the host to accept my cancellation request. I am a bit unsure of what I should do if she does not accept it. The system allows her 24 hours to respond, but since the app did not show my cancellation request and it would be after the check-in time, so I am not very comfortable with that. Would Airbnb be able to know the whole story and give me a full refund? I also have the choice to cancel this by myself now, and the cancellation policy allows me to get a full refund before check-in time. But my will is to have this sorted with the host cancelling the trip herself so she can face whatever consequences are (and I already prepared my story for a negative review).

Have you encountered similar problems? Should there be anything indicating that my message is sent through cancellation - cancel by host function? And How would Airbnb do if the cancellation is after the check-in time?

,AirBnB,"My partner is looking to go to Hawaii for a month. They found a studio apt listing on AirBnB that rents for $89/night. The owner offered the option to book off-platform for 30 days at $1,600 paid via Venmo (which is a savings of $1,070). 

Their email communication has been pretty thorough (as in, the owner has detailed and genuine-sounding answers to all questions).

,AirBnB,"Hi, this my first time using AirBnb and I am currently renting out a place for me and my family, but there are several issues that we have with the place. For one, the place was described as being on a quiet street but there is currently construction going on right in front of us from early morning until the middle of the day, we've moved in recently so it is safe to assume that it has been going on before we even arrived, yet despite this, we were not given any prior warning. Also the washing machine is leaking water, which means we can't use it. Also, the place listed said it had three beds, one single, one double and one sofa bed. But the single and sofa bed are crammed in a tiny room meaning that the sofa bed cannot extend properly to be slept on, not that it would matter much anyways as it is unsanitary and has cobwebs on it, meaning one of us has to sleep on the floor.

We spoke to the host and the co-host came over yesterday. He seemingly ""fixed"" the washing machine only for it to start leaking water again the next day, and he didn't seem to care about the other problems as mentioned above.

So are we right in wanting to ask for a partial refund? We are still using the place but there are several amenities that are either not working or falsely described which we feel hard done about.

Also, should we do this after we check-out? I don't want the rest of our stay to be ruined by this dispute.

,AirBnB,"Hi all: 

I need some help and tips. I have booked an Airbnb for one month in Mexico (Tulum) to be specific. I noticed after booking that the host has the same apartment (identical) in furniture 3 times listed. It was a new listing when I booked. A few weeks later the first review said it was a completely differnt place than he booked when he arrived. I contacted AirBNB support to get a refund because I am not comfortable staying there. 

However, AirBNB said the host has been unresponsive and for that reason they cannot issue an refund:

Lastly the refund policy on the listing states: 

&amp;#x200B;

"" 

**Free cancellation for 48 hours**

**After that, cancel up to 7 days before check-in and get a 50% refund, minus the service fee.""**

This is also false because when I click refund it says I get like $1.00 back or something.

&lt;p&gt;I need some help and tips. I have booked an Airbnb for one month in Mexico (Tulum) to be specific. I noticed after booking that the host has the same apartment (identical) in furniture 3 times listed. It was a new listing when I booked. A few weeks later the first review said it was a completely differnt place than he booked when he arrived. I contacted AirBNB support to get a refund because I am not comfortable staying there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, AirBNB said the host has been unresponsive and for that reason they cannot issue an refund: &lt;/p&gt;

,AirBnB,"Staying as a guest in Montreal for two weeks. I’m writing this on Thursday in week 1. I decided to come here with my friend and work from the Airbnb but also just get a change of scenery. Started a new job, so I’d be working remotely. We found a spot in a great part of the city for what seemed like a steal of a price. 

When I first got in, immediately I noticed there was a lot of wear and tear in the apartment. The bathroom wasn’t « extremely clean », the bathtub was gross with a hole as drainage and rust around it, and an actual hole in the wall where the faucet is. I excused all of this because well, « I get what I pay for ». 

First night, I noticed a strong uncomfortable scent on the pillows and bedding, I immediately text my friend who was coming a bit later to bring bedding to replace what the host provided. I also told him to bring cleaning supplies as none were provided and we’d have to be doing some light cleaning if we were staying for 2 weeks. When he arrived a day later, he was so disgusted with the state of the place (he also has OCD), that he spent the morning scrubbing and cleaning all over the bathroom, then the next day on his bedroom. The windows in both rooms were filthy when opened (interestingly enough the host had a rule where windows were not to be open, but the apartment has no ventilation so it gets incredibly hot if we don’t). 

I excuse all this as, « we get what we pay for ». Then I find out, electrical outlets in the bedroom I’m staying in don’t work during the day. I send a message to the host, who says he’ll send someone to take a look at it. The person comes, does something in the kitchen, and says the problem should be fixed. It’s not. But I’m so exasperated between this new job, back to back meetings, problems with the Airbnb that I just dismiss everything and work around the inconvenience. 

Then the crux. Wifi is terrible in the bedrooms, not even serviceable. We disconnected all our phones and tablets from the wifi and tried using just one phone in the bedroom, it can’t even load YouTube.  First few days I remedied this by hot spotting my personal data and connecting my laptop through there. This is unsustainable as now I’ve reached my data cap. So wifi works in the common area where the router and modems are, but incredibly poor connection in the bedrooms. Quality on video calls is non existant. I would rather have my meetings and calls in the bedroom with door closed then in the common area where my roommate is walking around doing things. It’s so frustrating because this is an apartment, not a house, there should be proper wifi coverage in the bedroom. 

I’ve enjoyed going on walks and seeing the city after work, but it’s been such a hellish experience so far that I just want to leave. But it’s way past the 24 hour period and all the money I paid will be lost.

Édit: oh and I forgot to add this. There is no microwave, even though it was stated in the listing. I’ve had to reheat food in the oven and purchase oven mits.

,AirBnB,"Hi all, 

I am brand new to Airbnb and this was my second booking with them ever. I had made a reservation that was accepted three weeks ago, and two days before my checkin I was trying to communicate with the host to understand the checkin process. The host never responded to calls or messages within the app, and actually screened one call. 

Two hours before I arrived in Vancouver, I'm on the phone with Airbnb customer support (for a half an hour waiting in line), and they said they will escalate the case to the Emergency response team.. I asked the customer service person when I will get a response from this emergency team, and she couldn't even give me a definite time but quoted up to ""two hours"". I also asked for a direct telephone line to support/customer service because relying on ""email message support"" is ridiculous when time is critical.

I ended up in Vancouver at 11pm, no message from emergency support and I'm traveling with animals. I had to find a hotel close to the Airbnb rental because I had important work the following day, and pay out of my own pocket, AND the Airbnb host still has my money for a week long booking.

The following day I STILL had no message from Airbnb, had to contact customer service AGAIN, and they told me the same crap AGAIN about this Emergency team contacting me. Now I still have no where to go, no support at all from Airbnb, and am out 1000$ for my booking I was supposed to be in !! 

Extremely stressed, pissed, and looking for advice on how to deal with Airbnb in this situation. How can they treat their guests like this? The whole business is providing accommodation and I'm sitting on the side of the road with no support or anything!! 
They should be putting me up in pet-friendly accomodations on their dime right now, and I feel entitled to a future booking credit - especially since my money has been tied up in this booking.

I imagine I'm not the first to dream of buying a few acres of land, and building multiple cabins / cottages on that property to rent out on AirBnB. However, looking into zoning stuff, this seems to be quite difficult to get approved.

\- Zoned for residential: impossible to do - at most, you can have a main house and a cottage, but the main house may have a minimum sq. footage requirement depending on your neighbors.

\- Zoned for agricultural: maybe possible, as you can say many of the cottages are for workers or other reasons, and less likely to have picky neighbors who will bother to fight against unconventional buildings.

,AirBnB,"This needs bit of a background to understand the situation, so going to be long.
Back in late February, we got in a very difficult situation where our house was damaged in a fire and we had to urgently find an accomodation. This house being listed in the same neighborhood was an ideal choice. As this was the the time Covid concerns were on a rise, we rushed in to finalise it. 
The listing didn't have enough picture or description to accurately describe the place. We hoped for the best and confirmed our stay with host.
The house just had a few piece of furniture, no beds, no chairs, no tables, empty kitchen with a few pieces of utensils which couldn't be used for cooking, no glasses or chinaware. We were assured that these will be provided shortly into our stay. Several pieces of furniture etc got delivered in the following weeks, some had to be replaced as they arrived damaged. we even helped assemble them and dispose off the packaging. 

Then after a month or so we saw a for sale sign being put up outside and a key box left on the door! When we contacted the host, we were told that the house is going up for sale but we can continue our stay.
It's only when we got a call from their realtor telling is her plans to photo shoot and organise showings, that we expressed our concern as this was the peak Covid time. They still insisted to do the photoshoot of the house, moving our personal stuff around. We wanted to change our booking after that and contacted Airbnb, but the host assured us that it was the end of it and their will no other requests. 

Timeline for repairs on our own house was getting delayed because of Covid and things being shutdown. But the host assured us we could have the place till July end, a total of 5 months as his closing date was scheduled for August. And with a baby, we decided not to move to another place at that time.

Since all this was going through my insurance company, the host tried to remove the monthly discount which was applied on the booking and increase the rent by 25% ! which we refused to accept.

The host didn't provided for any replenishment for the cleaning supplies or toiletries etc, nor did they respond to requests for maintaining the front and rear yard. They didn't even provide a hose pipe to water the lawn which eventually became an eyesore.

We were just anxious to move back to our house then do multiple moves, which we eventually had to as our still not ready! 

The problem starts when we finally move out, after a week of us moving out they started sending us text messages on my phone accusing us of leaving the house dirty, we did clean before leaving. Left all garbage out, no dirty dishes, emptied the refrigerator etc. 

Then in subsequent days I stated to get more messages for damage to the furniture, holes made in the walls. All of the stuff that needed fixing and same condition we got the place in. The walls even had crayon graffiti all over them, thankfully he didn't blame that on is as our kid is way too small for that.

It reached a point where he wanted us to buy the old carpet that was in the house as he claimed its too dirty to be cleaned now.

I just had to disengage with him at that point and decided to wait for Airbnb to intervene at some point.

I need help in how to handle this situation with such a hostile host?

Since he had to fix his house before closing the sale, he's trying to blame everything on us. I'm sure he will be sending is a claim for damages soon.

We don't have any pictures of the house when we moved, maybe some but it never occurred to is that we could be such a situation.

How does one respond to these allegations?

Since we're in another Airbnb right now, some of the precautions we are already taking- go through Airbnb for all communications, photograph all existing damages. But wonder how much detail can one document? End of the day it all depends on the person you're dealing with.

Will appreciate some pointers or advice on this situation.

,AirBnB,"TL;DR I am a nurse that is handling COVID-19 patients and get sent around the country for different assignments. I booked an Airbnb, had my assignment changed, and cancelled a month in advance of my booking. Despite explaining the situation, the host and Airbnb are refusing to refund me. I am being forced to pay the full $2100 charge. 

I hope I am posting this in the correct spot! I am a traveling nurse that gets assignments in various parts of the country based on hospital needs. Right now, during the pandemic, my contracts are based on the amount of covid cases. I wasn’t aware of this at the time, but they can be cancelled and changed if needs change. 

I accepted a contract and happily found a nice Airbnb to stay in during the duration of my contract. Unfortunately, about a month before the contract began, the contract was cancelled, and I was provided with other options. I immediately cancelled the Airbnb, but it unfortunately had an awful cancellation policy that didn’t allow for any sort of refund. I had no idea there would be a chance I would need to cancel so I didn’t pay much attention to this. 

I have a new contract in a different part of the country and a new Airbnb. I explained the situation to my host. They not only responded very angrily, they lied about providing me a refund. They said that they did provide a partial refund and just didn’t. I contacted Airbnb, and they said it was completely up to the host and couldn’t help. They also confirmed that the host lied about the refund.

I understand that I screwed up by selecting a place with a bad cancellation policy, and I understand that I should have known that the contract could have been cancelled. If this was for a vacation, I’d simply accept that it’s my fault. Im really upset over this though. I’ve been working 4, 12 hour shifts a week taking care of COVID patients in an ICU. It’s terrifying and awful. I spend my free time sleeping or relaxing, and I didn’t spend the time I should have vetting the Airbnb. I’m appalled at the way the host spoke to me and handled this. I’m annoyed that Airbnb won’t show any compassion for this unique situation. It’s really stressing me out. This is a lot of money for me.

A guesthad cancelled their reservation on me the last second. Demanded a full refund but we explained how.the strict policy we have in place works. 

He retaliated by leaving a 1 star review that only says he doesnt like how the strict policy works and nothing to do with me and the reservation. Initially I told airbnb the situation and said a guest shouldn't be allowed to leave a poor review when the substance isn't relevant to their stay which didn't even happen. 

They said it doesnt go against their review policy which says different when I read them. 
After that my account was suspended for 30 days. During that period I had three other guess leave 5 star reviews back to back.
Last night received an email last night saying they have closed down just my hosting account and not traveling. 
I had asked a specialist about it which he said I could try to appeal it. I told him what's going on recently and how I have good intentions to make everything right to be a good host. I had spent a huge amount of time and money with renovation work while my account was placed on a 30 day suspension. 
I'm curious if anyone else has ever dealt with a situation like this before and what did they do and the results of it or know if a similar situation.
I did realize I had an old account I never used but it set up from a long time ago before I became serious with the account I'm using now. I never listed or used it before but it's there and gives me the option of creating a list. 
In the worst case scenario that airbnb doesnt consider my reappeal and being able to lift the closed hosting part of my account what would be my next possible options if I try to make this work with Airbnb. 
Should I just delete this account all together and try to use and build up the old account I have that I never use? 

In the link I have screenshots of the messages I received from an email and messages of what the airbnb specialist told me. 
In the second link i have screen shots of what my current account appears as. Then i have images of how the old account looks like ""Angus"". Any tips or suggestions or anything would be greatly greatly appreciated.

,AirBnB,"Private room in a 4 bedroom house.    One long term tenant in room A, adult family member in room B, room C for airbnb guests,  master bedroom for host.

Laundry list of rules.  $2400 (!) security damage deposit.   Lots of ways to get charged extra fees but actual fees not specified.   One thing that I tell hosts in advance is I work from home using my own equipment, power bar.   Unfortunately this includes night shifts but I am careful to be respectful since most people are sleeping then.   Three rules I've never seen before.

\--If a guest decides to stay up during quiet hours (11pm- 7:30am) , absolutely no light is to leak from the guest room into the master bedroom (the host's room).   Your door must remain closed at all times.

My thoughts: of course I'll keep the door closed at all times when I'm in the room, but how am I going to block light from shining between the door's edges and frame?   It's not as if I'll have a spotlight shining at the door.  Is the host so sensitive to light coming from the hallway?  She reminded me of this rule. I haven't booked yet.

\--One bathroom to be shared by 3 guest rooms.  Note that the half bathroom (shower, toilet, sink) downstairs is not to be used by guest under any circumstances.   This and the master bedroom ensuite are reversed for the host. Failure to comply with this rule will result in loss of security deposit.  Furthermore, the living room, kitchen chairs, basement, garden are off limits to guests.

My thoughts:  One bathroom shared between 3 guest rooms is OK, but if you have to go urgently, what's the big deal about using a common space toilet?   Seems like the master ensuite is reserved for host and her husband (reasonable, it's their room) + extra half bathroom for her family too.

\--  If guests wish to change their stay dates, extend, reduce or cancel, this must be done 10 days in advance of the date the change will go into effect.    So let's say I book for Aug 23-Aug 31st.    According to this rule, I need to book today or tomorrow and tomorrow is also the deadline to make any changes.

My thoughts :  I understand that the host wants guests who know what they want, have set plans so she can more easily plan others guests' stays.

\--- If guests who stay 10 nights or more are found to have used an above average or excessive amount of energy and the utility bill reflects this, this will result in additional expenses billed to the guest, per the rental terms.

My thoughts:  OK I get it if you have a window air conditioner and set it to cool to 64F day and night, bring your own appliances that consume a lot, but how does she measure this and what does it mean per rental terms?   Sorry but this seems like a really cheap and controlling host.

Edit: I asked for clarification and the host advised if I run the fan (provided in the room) 24/7, that would be considered excessive electricity use, increase her bill and the guest would be subject to extra charges.   Don't know how she plans to measure electricity usage in a shared space or even enforce this.   Will she be questioning a guest every time they run a fan when the a/c is on?

This space sounds like somewhere that guests will be walking on eggshells, worried they might break the long list of rules, that they might set foot in the wrong room and get scolded for it...in short an uncomfortable stay where the host will watch your every move.

Would you book this place, ask specific questions about rules or move on and seek another space?

Edit:  I've reviewed the responses, the rules and our correspondence in the app ,and I've decided this host is too frugal and controlling at the expense of the guests' comfort and convenience.   If she complains about the usage of a fan and yet on the other side has fancy living room that is inaccessible to the guests, along with a $2400 security deposit, not to mention overbearing language threatening the guest with penalties, I decided this is not a good match.

Don&amp;#39;t know how she plans to measure electricity usage in a shared space or even enforce this.   Will she be questioning a guest every time they run a fan when the a/c is on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This space sounds like somewhere that guests will be walking on eggshells, worried they might break the long list of rules, that they might set foot in the wrong room and get scolded for it...in short an uncomfortable stay where the host will watch your every move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you book this place, ask specific questions about rules or move on and seek another space?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:  I&amp;#39;ve reviewed the responses, the rules and our correspondence in the app ,and I&amp;#39;ve decided this host is too frugal and controlling at the expense of the guests&amp;#39; comfort and convenience.   If she complains about the usage of a fan and yet on the other side has fancy living room that is inaccessible to the guests, along with a $2400 security deposit, not to mention overbearing language threatening the guest with penalties, I decided this is not a good match.   I&amp;#39;ll look for a more easy going welcoming host instead.&lt;/p&gt;

,AirBnB,"Dear redditors, 

First of all, sorry, English is not my first language.
TL:DR underneath the long post + UPDATE

We are currently staying at an Airbnb in Spain, with a very difficult lady. It's a one month rental. She let us know 4 days before our arrival that the pool had to be fixed, and it should take a couple of days. We were bummed, but, hey, Corona has been hard on everyone and it's not always easy to find workers so we just sucked it up and said nothing.

We are now 7 days in, the pool has been fixed but is still empty.  She is now trying to coerce us into paying 375€ for a water tank truck (we already paid 2 200€ for the rental) for the pool to be filled. She claims that as Airbnb gave us a discount for the 30 days stays, we should be able to afford it and we should contribute. We obviously said no, saying that the rental price was agreed upon, sorry if it does not cover unexpected maintenance costs, and if the discount was wrongly calculated, it is something she needs to sort with Airbnb, both being neither our problem or responsibility. 


To add some details, she lives upstairs, although she listed the property as a full house. She is being very difficult about everything. She even came by one day because she ""heard"" that we left the fan on all night( no airco in the house and we are in the middle of a heat wave), so she brought a timer because it's dangerous to leave the fan on for more than an hour.

We wrote her a message saying that we feel very uncomfortable because of all her interventions since we arrived (she sent us a message when we left one light on one afternoon and another day because we used the cooking fan for too long). But mainly it was her comments about hearing what happens in the bedroom that made us feel like we have no privacy here and cannot relax. She brushed it off, giving excuses of how hard it is right now for her, with the pool costs and everything. We suspect that she is just verrrrrry cheap, which is why she tries to make us feel bad about anything that uses electricity but it's really ruining our holidays. 

Do you know if it's worth trying to get Airbnb involved while we are guests? Is there any chance they could help us find another place nearby and get some of our money back to be able to enjoy the rest of our holidays? Or is it a lost cause until we are far away? 

TL:DR difficult host asking for more money and invading our privacy, is it worth getting Airbnb involved? 

UPDATE: We followed your advice and contacted Airbnb through Twitter. It took about 10 hours, but we got someone attached to our case who called us and her. We said we did not want any money back, just to settle the matter and make sure she would not keep asking for more money or invade our privacy. 
 
He told her that we are not liable to pay for any part of filling the pool, hopefully she will back off from now on. 

He also told us, as many of you pointed out that no pool before or upon arrival is a valid reason to cancel. As we really needed this place and it's a secluded area with no other options around, we wanted to believe her when she said it would only be for a couple of days. But we'll know better for next time and cancel immediately. And she already sounded like a difficult person at the time, I should have trusted my gut feeling.

This was the last response from the owner:


Hello again,

Thanks for your reply. As I mentioned, Airbnb will handle the rental process on our behalf.
The first step :
 I will put the ad online on Airbnb and send you a booking request, for this i need your full name and email address.
Step two (Reservation):
The first month of rent plus security deposit that you have to pay in advance is 100 % refundable if you do not agree with the apartment. Once you confirm reservation an Airbnb agent will contact you for viewing (or video viewing available) and sign the contract. After the inspection you will tell your decision: TAKE THE APARTMENT or NOT ! If you don't take the apartment they will refund your payment. Airbnb requests payment in advance to be sure that the client really has the intention of renting the property. This is the Airbnb policy.
The security deposit will play as holding fee as well and will be refunded immediately with no questions asked if you don't like the place or once the contract will end if you decide to rent. ( But only if the apartment is not vandalized ). Again, the payment is going to be made to Airbnb and not to me, in this way I will be sure that you will come to our meeting and you can be sure that I cannot touch the money until the rental contract is signed. If for some reason you decide not to rent it, Airbnb will make you a full refund in 24 hours. The payment deposit must be confirmed in 2 working days because other way I have to open another case with Airbnb and I must pay for every case. After the payment is done let me know the day when you want to see the apartment.
If you find it acceptable please provide the requested details and I will submit your application right away. I will send the Airbnb booking request to your email and you can take it from there.",t2_2z480y1o,False,,0,False,Is this normal?,[],r/AirBnB,False,6,,0,,False,t3_i8afv2,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1597251965.0,text,6,,,text,self.AirBnB,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m looking to rent someone’s property long term through Airbnb but there requesting £1000 security deposit + first month rent to only view the property!&lt;/p&gt;

I asked him how to get a refund, and he told me to accept some new dates that he proposed so he could cancel with a full refund. Thing is, I haven't received any notification or such about any date change. I messaged him yesterday asking about how it's suposed to work, but I haven't received a response for the last 24 hours.

,AirBnB,"Hello,

I'm currently pretty surprised - I had a review removed recently for a stay where I rated almost everything a 5 and I rated the location a low number (probably 2).  My words were friendly and rational, but I mentioned how the location did not work for me and how it might not work for others under certain circumstances.  I was positive on other items including cleanliness.  I was about to book AirBnB again (I spend thousands every year), and I noticed the reviews I wrote which weren't 5's are all gone.  That's curious, I thought. 

I'm currently asking AirBNB to tell me what specific policy I violated, and the chat person was surprisingly snarky.  I'm not the emotive type in these things, so now I'm beginning to question whether I should trust future bookings.  

I had another booking where it was all 5 stars and the toilet was electric and things needed to be 'pushed', and also it had never been cleaned (and the guests clothing was everywhere).  There, I left no review, but everyone else had 5 stars.  And I'm reading in the press about similar ""5 star"" listings.

,AirBnB,"First time booking on Airbnb. The stay will be for a little over three months. Found a great place. Asked the host if he would make it a bit cheaper because of extra long stay + winter time in a beach/summer setting and he send me an offer thing which was a good bit cheaper than the original €/month. I accepted and put in payment info. 

Turns out that he made a mistake and that it was meant to be that price per month,  but he put it in as price for the entire stay. He noticed after I accepted. I’m fine with paying that per month and think it’s really great that he reduced the price. 

I asked how to fix it and he said (both not native English speakers) “cancel and make again”. This happened all in one day so I would get all my money back - but does it make a difference if I cancel or he cancels?

Question for stays booked prior to March 14th, COVID EC and alteration requests after then:

I can't find in Airbnb EC's policy about what happens when the guest submits an alteration request after March 14th.

Will the guest be able to obtain a full refund if they meet the criteria?

In February, european guest booked a 20 days US stay in September. Guest now requests an alteration to expand dates, however I am concerned guest will have to cancel all together because they are not even sure they'll be provided a VISA.

I would have thought given the reservation date was amended post March 14th that standard cancelation policy should apply, however I've asked airbnb support multiple times and received completely different answers.

Apologies if this didn't warrant a separate post, a DM suggested this was the best way to update.

So... around 11 am I get a message from Bob saying: ""Good morning. We’re very sorry and it won’t happen again. Once again so sorry.""

Of course at this point I have read comments here so I responded saying: I appreciate the apology but multiple house rules were broken and we cannot have people staying at our property that are not on the reservation. The only person on the reservation was him and his dog, everyone else needs to leave and needs to do so within the next hour. 

Probably 10-15 minutes later, I was out in the garage and one of them, not Bob, walks out and gets in the back seat of the car. So I walk over and say hello. He rolls down the window as he quickly puts out his joint, I did see the joint, and the car was full of smoke. Again I don't have anything against marijuana and he COULD have had a prescription, but he was clearly trying to hide it. So I asked if he had gotten my messages and he said yes, they are leaving.

For the next 20 minutes or so they are all wandering around the backyard looking for something.. my wife is getting more and more annoyed but I am trying to keep things civil and they assured me that they were leaving. Then she looks out the window and see's Bob playing disc golf. I have a basket in the lawn and usually leave discs in it. Wife walks out and asks if he's looking for something, or what it is that he is doing. He indicates to her that he is not leaving. He paid for two nights we can't force him to leave. She tells him he has 30 minutes and then she is calling the cops.

So he keeps wandering around, he's not even dressed just walking around in shorts. Everyone else is sitting outside by the car. He then walks into our kitchen, which is in the upstairs area of the house and informs us that he can't find his sandals and he is not leaving without his sandals and he is accusing us of taking them. So I ask him what they look like and that we will gladly ship them to him when we find them which he refuses. 

He kept saying: this is an airbnb, I paid, you can't make me leave. ""Dawg you have MYYYY propertyyyy"", ""I can't leave without myyy proppperrrtttyyy"" ""I drove here from NEWWWWW Yoooorkk daaawwwwgg"". ""This is airbnb, you can't do this.""

I said: I will mail you your $5 flip flops when we find them. You can expect a bill for the $800 pool cleaner that you broke. I have already filed a report with airbnb detailing the rules that were broken. People that are not listed on the booking are not allowed on the property. 

He then insists that they didn't break any rules. So I opened the guestbook and pointed to each rule that was broken to which he obviously had nothing to say and was just pulling on his hair and changing the subject. 

At this point one of the females opens the door and yells: Bob! Stop being a fucking asshole! Let's fucking go! Your sandals are in the car!

Bob then runs downstairs saying: oh where were they? They were in the fucking car! You're such a fucking asshole. 

He then tries to lecture us about allowing guests during a pandemic. Which is something that we have not taken lightly and only recently began allowing visits on a limited basis. He is going to have us banned from airbnb. He is going to sue us. etc. etc. 

At this point I said enough, I'm calling the cops, he kept saying I was bluffing and the cops weren't going to do anything anyway and he would gladly wait right there until the cops came. I said that's fine by me, in fact I prefer it then when they find your drugs you'll have even more problems. He scoffed and kept saying I was bluffing so I turned the speaker phone on so he could hear the call at which point he finally slinked over to his car and got in to leave.. 

I stayed on the phone with the police until they were off the property at which time the officer stated that unless we wanted them to come to the house still that he wasn't going to report it.

So that's that. I called airbnb again to follow up.

,AirBnB,"TLDR: we had/have a guest from hell, some things have already been damaged, any chance of getting reimbursement from airbnb?

Due to the pandemic we are being extra careful with bookings: blocking days before and after guest visits to allow for proper cleaning, screening new users, etc. Our listing is for a private room, it is actually almost an entire in-law suite with two rooms, two beds, half bath and an exercise room. We are getting a ton of requests / inquiries from new users with 0 reviews and asking: ""Is this for the whole house?"" ""Can I rent the entire house?"" etc. 

So we had a request from a guy we'll call Bob, who is as described a new user. As such I did my usual explanation of the guest space, that we live in the upstairs of the house, quiet hours after 8pm, no parties, etc. He said that's fine he is coming to visit family and go for a hike and mentioned the name of the trail which is a trail I am very familiar with. So it seemed all good. He then followed up asking if it was ok to bring a small dog that is registered as an emotional support animal. Sure, that should be ok.

Jump to the day of arrival, I ask if he can share what time he will be arriving and he says: ""We should be there around 7pm"". Again the booking was for 1 but I thought maybe by ""we"" he means him and the dog. Ok.. see you then.

12:30 am he shows up. I go to show him around and it is him and a female standing by the door. I was surprised as I only expected one person and a dog but we don't charge extra per person unless it's more than 2 people anyway. So I show them around, explain that the pool cleaner is running and that I will take it out in the morning. He says no problem they won't be swimming during the night... great.

2:30 am I wake up and wife is holding our crying baby and I can hear screaming outside. So I ask wth is going on and she says since about 1 am, probably right when I fell asleep, they have been going in and out of the house, swimming in the pool, drinking, smoking, screaming, having a grand old time. Now my wife sometimes exaggerates and I find this hard to believe that a couple is carrying on this way to which she informs me that it's not a couple.. there are 6 people. 

So I get dressed and head outside and talk to one of the females and ask where Bob is. She doesn't know. I tell her that it's too loud, that we have quiet hours after 8pm, can she please go find Bob. She goes inside.. 30 minutes or so go by and no Bob. So I message him via Airbnb and reiterate: please keep the noise down and also mention that the booking was for 1 person and there are apparently 6 people. 

Now, I know that he at least saw this message as in the app it shows ""Bob is typing"". However for the next hour or so I hear the doors opening and closing, almost non-stop, no more screaming / yelling but still a bit obnoxious. Finally around 4 am I am fed up and look out the window. Bob is literally wandering around in circles in the driveway in his boxers. A woman gets out of the car completely naked and runs across the driveway into the house. Another woman is laying in the grass, rolling back and forth, giggling. So yet again I go out to talk to Bob. He is completely incoherent and I'm sure has no recollection of this conversation. 

4:30 am I hear a car, look out the window and I see Bob's car leaving. I have no idea who was driving but I know Bob was in no shape to be doing so. At this point I have no idea what is going on or if they are coming back. 5:30 am they are back. At this point I am sitting at my desk and have a clear view of the driveway. I am at my desk until about 6:30 am, I can see that there are people in the car but no one has gotten out. At about 8 am I go down to the garage and I can see there is no longer anyone in Bob's car. I also see that the side door, which is the guest entrance, is wide open. 

I then head over to the pool and I see that our pool cleaner has been removed from the pool and it appears that it was tossed into the bushes. The pool cleaner has a quick release on the hose that attaches to a return line and it appears that whoever removed the cleaner was not aware how to use the quick release and just pulled on the hose until they ripped it off. So I rig it up as best I can with some hose clamps only to find when I hook it up that another valve is cracked and water is literally spraying everywhere. So at the least I need a new valve. Great. What else? I also see that the lid for the skimmer is open so I take a look in there. The skimmer door is gone. Now this falls out now and then so not that big of a deal but I can't find it anywhere. Two of the pieces were in the pool but the door itself is nowhere to be found. So at present I have no pool cleaner and the skimmer is not functioning which means not much water circulation.

Assuming I can just replace the valve on the cleaner and repair the hose I'm looking at about $100, if that doesn't work the cleaner itself is about $800.

So yea at this point I'm fairly angry and am picking up some trash they left outside when I step in something and... it's vomit. 

Since then I have sent Bob multiple messages detailing the damage and issues and have asked him to please find other accommodations for the rest of his stay. I haven't offered to reimburse him for the second night but I am willing to if it means they are out of my house. 

We have contacted airbnb and were told that a supervisor would be reaching out to us to help resolve the issue but so far we haven't heard back from them. 

So is there any chance airbnb will reimburse me for these damages or am I just SOL?

Edit: I have no clue what time they eventually went to sleep but I know it was at least after 6 am. So I am not expecting them to be awake any time soon. I really just want them out of the house and I'm worried what i will find in the guest space when they finally do leave.

&lt;p&gt;2:30 am I wake up and wife is holding our crying baby and I can hear screaming outside. So I ask wth is going on and she says since about 1 am, probably right when I fell asleep, they have been going in and out of the house, swimming in the pool, drinking, smoking, screaming, having a grand old time. Now my wife sometimes exaggerates and I find this hard to believe that a couple is carrying on this way to which she informs me that it&amp;#39;s not a couple.. there are 6 people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I get dressed and head outside and talk to one of the females and ask where Bob is. She doesn&amp;#39;t know. I tell her that it&amp;#39;s too loud, that we have quiet hours after 8pm, can she please go find Bob. She goes inside.. 30 minutes or so go by and no Bob. So I message him via Airbnb and reiterate: please keep the noise down and also mention that the booking was for 1 person and there are apparently 6 people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I know that he at least saw this message as in the app it shows &amp;quot;Bob is typing&amp;quot;. However for the next hour or so I hear the doors opening and closing, almost non-stop, no more screaming / yelling but still a bit obnoxious. Finally around 4 am I am fed up and look out the window. Bob is literally wandering around in circles in the driveway in his boxers. A woman gets out of the car completely naked and runs across the driveway into the house. Another woman is laying in the grass, rolling back and forth, giggling. So yet again I go out to talk to Bob. He is completely incoherent and I&amp;#39;m sure has no recollection of this conversation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4:30 am I hear a car, look out the window and I see Bob&amp;#39;s car leaving. I have no idea who was driving but I know Bob was in no shape to be doing so. At this point I have no idea what is going on or if they are coming back. 5:30 am they are back. At this point I am sitting at my desk and have a clear view of the driveway. I am at my desk until about 6:30 am, I can see that there are people in the car but no one has gotten out. At about 8 am I go down to the garage and I can see there is no longer anyone in Bob&amp;#39;s car. I also see that the side door, which is the guest entrance, is wide open. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then head over to the pool and I see that our pool cleaner has been removed from the pool and it appears that it was tossed into the bushes. The pool cleaner has a quick release on the hose that attaches to a return line and it appears that whoever removed the cleaner was not aware how to use the quick release and just pulled on the hose until they ripped it off. So I rig it up as best I can with some hose clamps only to find when I hook it up that another valve is cracked and water is literally spraying everywhere. So at the least I need a new valve. Great. What else? I also see that the lid for the skimmer is open so I take a look in there. The skimmer door is gone. Now this falls out now and then so not that big of a deal but I can&amp;#39;t find it anywhere. Two of the pieces were in the pool but the door itself is nowhere to be found. So at present I have no pool cleaner and the skimmer is not functioning which means not much water circulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming I can just replace the valve on the cleaner and repair the hose I&amp;#39;m looking at about $100, if that doesn&amp;#39;t work the cleaner itself is about $800.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yea at this point I&amp;#39;m fairly angry and am picking up some trash they left outside when I step in something and... it&amp;#39;s vomit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then I have sent Bob multiple messages detailing the damage and issues and have asked him to please find other accommodations for the rest of his stay. I haven&amp;#39;t offered to reimburse him for the second night but I am willing to if it means they are out of my house. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have contacted airbnb and were told that a supervisor would be reaching out to us to help resolve the issue but so far we haven&amp;#39;t heard back from them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is there any chance airbnb will reimburse me for these damages or am I just SOL?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I have no clue what time they eventually went to sleep but I know it was at least after 6 am. So I am not expecting them to be awake any time soon. I really just want them out of the house and I&amp;#39;m worried what i will find in the guest space when they finally do leave.&lt;/p&gt;

,AirBnB,"Hello. I’m hoping for some advice before complaining to the host, in the event that I’m being overly sensitive.

We are on our honeymoon, and booked a guest house/converted garage on the host’s home property for Weds-Sun in middle-of-nowhere, OH at about $220 a night. The sole reason we chose this was for the access to the host’s inground, private pool. The host is aware of this, as when I booked, I made absolutely sure with her that the pool would be open and ready for use by our arrival, and let her know that if it wouldn’t be, I would cancel the reservation to allow another guest to book. The host assured me that the pool was ready for us. By a stroke of luck, no other guests are here and the host is out of town, and we have the small guest house and large property to ourselves.

However, the pool has been murky due to a chemical imbalance since we arrived. It’s like swimming in milky water, and you can’t see further than a foot beyond the surface.

,AirBnB,"Hello and thanks in advance for any replies!

Im located in MN and yesterday I had my every other year inspection from the MN Department of Health. When I first acquired my permit/license to operate I was told that I had to collect the first and last names of all registered guests for emergency purposes only for the City.. not the state. (For example, say there is a fire and the first responders need to know who to account for.) Anyway, I've been asking people to write to me the names of all registered guests prior to receiving the code for entry in the messaging platform. That's been going ok so far. Now yesterday the inspector informed me that MN requires me to obtain the first and last names, AND home addresses, AND the make/model/license plate numbers of all vehicles of guests.

AirBnB has a place for the guest to enter the names of all registered guests, but I as the host cannot see all their names unless they all have an account with AirBnB. This is not going to be the case a majority of the time since my home sleeps up to 14 people and many times it's only the host that has an account. I also have my listing on VRBO and there is not a place for guests to do this. Now in addition, I have to ask for the addresses of everyone staying in the home and their vehicle information and there isn't a place on the reservation platforms for this to be entered. What a pain in the you-know-what!

Here are some thoughts and questions:

1. Has anyone else recently been informed they need to gather this information? I was told that next time I get inspected, they may ask to see my registration log with all the documentation to be sure I'm complying. I was also told that because of the new contact tracing being done for COVID-19, that they have been entertaining the idea of doing random checks on STRs to be sure we are complying. Ugh!
2. How can I get in touch with AirBnB or VRBO to have them gather the required information when guests book? It seems that if there are state and local laws mandating this information, it would be easier for the reservation platforms to gather this from the beginning rather than the hosts having to ask for it separately.
3. Does anyone have a good process they use to collect this information?

&lt;p&gt;Im located in MN and yesterday I had my every other year inspection from the MN Department of Health. When I first acquired my permit/license to operate I was told that I had to collect the first and last names of all registered guests for emergency purposes only for the City.. not the state. (For example, say there is a fire and the first responders need to know who to account for.) Anyway, I&amp;#39;ve been asking people to write to me the names of all registered guests prior to receiving the code for entry in the messaging platform. That&amp;#39;s been going ok so far. Now yesterday the inspector informed me that MN requires me to obtain the first and last names, AND home addresses, AND the make/model/license plate numbers of all vehicles of guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AirBnB has a place for the guest to enter the names of all registered guests, but I as the host cannot see all their names unless they all have an account with AirBnB. This is not going to be the case a majority of the time since my home sleeps up to 14 people and many times it&amp;#39;s only the host that has an account. I also have my listing on VRBO and there is not a place for guests to do this. Now in addition, I have to ask for the addresses of everyone staying in the home and their vehicle information and there isn&amp;#39;t a place on the reservation platforms for this to be entered. What a pain in the you-know-what!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some thoughts and questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has anyone else recently been informed they need to gather this information? I was told that next time I get inspected, they may ask to see my registration log with all the documentation to be sure I&amp;#39;m complying. I was also told that because of the new contact tracing being done for COVID-19, that they have been entertaining the idea of doing random checks on STRs to be sure we are complying. Ugh!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I get in touch with AirBnB or VRBO to have them gather the required information when guests book? It seems that if there are state and local laws mandating this information, it would be easier for the reservation platforms to gather this from the beginning rather than the hosts having to ask for it separately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does anyone have a good process they use to collect this information? If AirBnB/VRBO doesn&amp;#39;t add a place to collect it, I&amp;#39;m tempted to create a form that I will have to have guests fill out prior to their arrival and then have them email it back to me. It seems to me that I&amp;#39;m inconveniencing the guests with all this &amp;quot;paperwork&amp;quot; and I want it to be a simply process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I honestly don&amp;#39;t want the names and home addresses of minors, but the inspector said it is not an option. WTH! Am I wrong in not wanting this?&lt;/li&gt;

,AirBnB,"Hello! 

I'm asking for advice because it's the first time I've used AirBnB and am a bit confused about how cancellations work even after looking all over their website and help center. 

I booked this in early February before COVID-19 happened for a stay later this year in November for me and  5 good friends that are from all over the U.S. and out of country to attend a convention together. COVID-19 decided nah and kicked our asses. It's unfortunate and we were all looking forward to seeing each other again but eh it's understandable.

We realized that the convention would be canceled most likely and I kept up with AirBnB's updates on COVID-19 cancellations (I didn't want to bother the host at the time if it was simply resolvable with their policies). Now that it's a month before my next 50% of payment, AirBnB is still saying only reservations up until September something and I'm realizing I'd probably have to fork up another $600 or so without a guarantee that it could be fully refunded. 

I read up on cancellations and learned that hosts can cancel the reservation and provide a full refund if they want, so I decided to give it a try and explain the situation to my host. Only half of us are local to Southern California and the rest are out of state and out of country and the friend out of country is simply unable to fly out here due to travel restrictions. The other friends are simply too scared to fly and there really isn't any motivation to visit anymore since the convention has indeed been canceled. 

The host said he understood and is willing to give a full refund however, I need to request the cancellation he says through AirBnB's customer service. Then he would be able to authorize a full refund. 

Do I cancel through the website then? Or am I supposed to call? While I'm cancelling the reservation is there an option to request for a full refund, service fee and all? Or do I ask the host to cancel while offering to refund the total amount?

,AirBnB,"Hi r/Airbnb, during the quarantine I decided to start a data mining and analysis side project on the subject of Airbnb with the goal of driving insights and value for hosts. I think I put together my first really interesting piece and I'd like to get your take on it.

Understanding that guests give an overall rating as well as ratings in individual categories, I wanted to know to what extent the individual category ratings had an influence on the overall rating.

I found that the overall rating is mostly (76%) explained by the category ratings, meaning how a guest rates a host on individual categories mostly predicts how they'll rate a host overall. Maybe this is obvious. What's perhaps more interesting is the flip-side of that which is 24% is not explainable by the category ratings. Some other, intangible factors beyond the categories must go into a guests decision on overall rating.

I then took that a step further to determine the importance of each category rating to the overall rating (how much each category contributed to the 76%). I found that accuracy, cleanliness, and value (18% each) are especially important to the overall score. Scoring high in these categories tends to lead to a high overall score.

Categories of less importance are less likely to influence overall score. A host can have great check-in (8%) and communication (10%) with a guest but if they don’t deliver on the above categories, they’re unlikely to receive a high overall score. Finally, location (3%) scores the lowest in terms of importance on the overall score. This says that guests are factoring location in the least when deciding what overall rating to give.

More detail and methodology can be found in the full write-up [here](https://bnbfacts.com/how-airbnb-category-ratings-affect-overall-rating/).

I booked one night in Paris Yesterday on an automatically accepted offer. My reservation was confirmed and accepted. I sent a message to the owner, who did not answer.

,AirBnB,"I'm fretting, perhaps unreasonably, about an email I received from Airbnb about a current guest.

The guest booked to stay for a month and about 2 weeks in they asked to extend their stay. So I amended the booking.

I received an email from Airbnb saying payment for this additional amount has failed. But what really stands out to me is this line from the email: *""If your guest doesn't successfully submit payment or if they cancel the reservation before making the payment, Airbnb isn't liable for issuing your host payout.""*

Does this mean I am being presented with the decision to cancel on this guest or else I lose out? And won't cancelling incur penalties for me?

I've tried speaking to Airbnb but they were no help. Their No.1 solution to a problem is to just redirect it to a different department.

,AirBnB,"I'm a host. I have a stand alone tiny cottage with a large landscaped yard and pool in a relatively secluded area. The cottage is technically my primary residence that I vacate to accommodate guests (I go into the city to my boyfriends about a half hour away). It is self check in /self check out. I am really cheap for the area and the amenities I provide, therefore booked pretty solid from early spring to late fall.

I find lately guests are trying to deter me from stopping by to do yard maintenance ( mow the lawn, backwash the pool, vaccum the pool, remove garbage/recycling, weed the gardens, restock the firewood, clean the firepit, remove tree junk from the decks, fill the birdfeeders, and other random stuff like fertilize/lime the lawn, sort recycling, etc.) 

It is clearly stated in my listing (and guide book) that depending on the time of year, I may have to stop by to perform these duties. All of these duties are weather pending. It takes me 4 to 5 hours of going at it like a demon to accomplish everything. I always give the guests 24 hours notice, and never arrive before 10am. I do not have to enter the cottage, or talk to them if they prefer, nor do they have to leave. I cannot do these duties between guests as there is simply not enough time. I work a few jobs and do it when it fits my schedule , and around the weather. 

I find myself having to explain to guests that I would rather be home in the air conditioning and not sweating buckets mowing and raking the lawns etc., that the pool does indeed require frequent chemical balancing (it's a heated pool) for their own safety (baceria etc.) and that if I let the lawn get too long, it takes me twice as long to do it, not to mention I keep it short to deter Ticks (which are a huge issue in my area). It's literally for their own (and my) safety.

 I'm getting worn down trying to justify WHY these things are important. I take pride in keeping the place looking great and I feel no one really gets how much freaking work goes into it. I always try to work around the guests and weather, but sometimes it just needs to be done when it's convenient for me. I get that they are booking my place to have some privacy, but if they book a week long time slot, there's absolutely no way I can neglect my pool or lawn for a week without issues. 

Am I being unreasonable? Do I need to do yet another diplomatically written write up on WHY I may have to be at my home for 4-5 hours to keep things nice and safe (my cottage guide is literally already 10 pages long and states the required yard maintenance)? Would it come off as being sarcastic if I did? ...Because I'm at a point that I am feeling quite sarcastic and may not be quite as diplomatic as I should/could be. I'm honestly not sure if I'm in the right , or if I'm disrespecting their privacy. Again, I am VERY reasonably priced so it's not like they're paying top dollar and ""losing"" a few hours of their vacation. I have never had these issues in prior years of hosting...everyone has been spectacular and undersstanding, and even hopeful to meet me.

Sorry for the long explaination. It has also been a rough year with some guests being rather shittier than ususal. I honestly put up with a lot and don't say a word , but holy god Corona virus has brought out the worst in some people.

The host accepted my reservation and the total came out to ~$500 for three nights. A few days later, the host sent an Alteration Request claiming a glitch in their API system caused a mistake in pricing. They are now requesting that I pay an additional $370 or they will cancel my stay. 

I called Airbnb for support, customer service basically said either pay up or cancel and find another place to stay. Options are already significantly more limited from when I first searched due to it being a busy weekend. I requested to speak with a supervisor at Airbnb but haven’t heard back yet. I checked my current listings prices for every other weekend in 2021 and they are no where near what they are trying to make me pay now. I feel like this is an unfair practice. I’m thinking they didn’t realize it was a busy weekend and are now trying to earn more $$. 

Can the host really get away with this / will Airbnb really let it slide? Not sure if I should pursue this or cut my losses.

,AirBnB,"I'm in a bad situation and I thought I might have a better chance of finding someone here who would have insight on what to do, than if I posted in a professional host group on facebook.  I've been a professional co-host for 4 years and have helped many hosts get superhost. This is the sad story of how airbnb is treating one of them.

• The place is booked mid March. It is booked for more than one night.

• On the last night, we get a call from someone claiming to be the guest claiming that their account was hacked and that they are not there.

• Airbnb cancels the reservation. The guest doesn't have to provide a police report to prove anything, airbnb just takes their word on it.  This means we get no payout for the booking/lost nights, not even cleaning fees.  Airbnb does NOT inform us that it was cancelled. No email, no phone call. Nothing. None of the nights that were stayed are to be paid out either.

• As soon as we find out (not from airbnb, they never contacted us at all to inform us what they knew dangerous people might be at our place, or that they were cancelling) we try to confront the alleged hackers at the house and they immediately ran away from the residence and escaped. They were in the middle of packing boxes with everything in the kitchen (plates etc). They were all men in their 20s, left drugs and alcohol everywhere etc. Maybe 10-15 of them.

• We discover that they had gone through every cupboard and draw and closet and box and attic looking for things to steal. They also caused some $17,000++ in damages (CAD). They were the worst kind of hooligans and completely trashed the place. (How is it fun to just break things for hours?)

• After 5 months of photos, other evidence, 3rd party in-person inspectors, receipts, contractors, and maybe a dozen+ hours of email correspondence with airbnb, they reply (after recent weeks of silence) that ""We only cover damages caused by the guest or an invitee of the guest so we will not cover anything."".

This smells like BS since they knew the situation 5 months ago and engaged in dialogue with me and my co-hosts for months and only now they realize that it was a hacked account?   Is this really the policy? If a guest isn't careful and gets their account hacked (or even just claims that), all the burden is on the host for the blocked nights, cleaning fee, damages, and theft?

That can't be right. And if it was a cheap night, or if the damages were a couple hundred we'd just let it go probably but close to $20K (CAD) is going to bankrupt us personally. We did everything possible to avoid this, if it is anyone's fault it is the guest who didn't keep their account secure, or maybe airbnb who didn't bother to inform us through any medium when they cancelled the booking.

Any help at all would be so very appreciated.

EDIT:  I mentioned it was mid march? It was the absolute pinnacle of the toilet paper and Lysol rush on the retailers where there were actually line ups, around the time that the US government told some guys selling hand sanitiser on amazon at a mark up (because it was scarce for life 4 days), that they were confiscating their hand sanitiser and that they were being forced to donate them all, if you remember that. Anyways guess what's the only thing we had to report as missing in the end, besides the damages they didn't take almost anything except... for.. lysol wipes and our cleaner's boxes of disposable gloves (which were the kinds of things in the locked closets they broke into. This place is set up for airbnb, never lived in).  Of course airbnb told us they do not cover ""supplies that get used up like soap, and cleaning products"".  Which was relatively very inexpensive so we wouldn't care about that but just insult to injury. That was the one bit of information that they could tell us conclusively immediately, before 5 months had elapsed for example. I guess that was a sign of things to come. You know I even had to pay someone to go there so that they would let in the 3rd party inspectors airbnb required us to use.

,AirBnB,"First-time AirBnB user here. I had to cancel an AirBnB listing about two weeks ago because of material misrepresentations in the listing that were discovered only after check-in. I had requested a refund for the cancelled stay (amounting to more than 30 days) through AirBnB, and the AirBnB support says they are still ""communicating with the host"" about my refund request. 

Now, the 14-day window for leaving reviews is fast closing. I do not have any reason to expect a negative review from the host OTHER THAN the fact that he might assume that I would leave him a negative review. 

In such a case, is it advisable for me to leave a review for the host?  It would be overall negative due to the misrepresentations. 

Thanks

*More details provided about the issues below:* 

The two main issues are:

1) The listing was for an ""entire suite"" in the basement, and ""laundry is shared"". It turned out that the laundry room of the house is located within the space of my basement suite, and the host would need to enter the suite to do laundry. Upon inquiry, the host replied that the listing had stated that ""laundry is shared"", but that he would give me advance notice when they need to do laundry. This to me is a rather unconventional (to put it very mildly) interpretation to the phrase ""shared laundry"", and it was not explained at all in the listing. If I were to rent a whole apartment unit with shared laundry, I certainly would not expect it to mean that the laundry facility is located within my apartment, and that other residents would enter my apartment to use the laundry facilities.

2) The listing described the housing as ""5 minutes' walk to the nearest train station"" (exact wording from the listing). It turned out that the nearest train station (there is only 1) was 15 minutes walk from house. Google map shows the walking distance to be 16 minutes. Upon inquiry, the host replied firstly that 1) HIS google map showed the walking distance to be ""12 minutes"", and 2) nonetheless, it would take ""HIM"" only 5 minutes to walk to the train station (apparently he is a fast walker).

I obviously was not happy with his responses, not that these are issues that could be fixed.

*Update*: AirBnB has decided to issue me a refund for the cancelled stay. I am happy about the outcome. 

I also left the host a review, which I feel is fair and balanced. I gave him an overall 3 stars. The text of the review is pasted below with redactions of names:

&gt; I booked the basement suite for a stay lasting more than 30 days. 
&gt; 
&gt; The suite was spacious, and the host was very responsive to concerns that could be addressed. For example, I found that the suite was a bit chilly, with a non-functioning heater. [Name of host redacted] went out and purchased a new heater within hours. [Name of host redacted] also checked in with me regularly to make sure that things were going fine. 
&gt; 
&gt; Nevertheless, I eventually had to cancel the stay because of two main inconsistencies between the description in the listing and the actual housing being offered. I want to first say that these inaccuracies may not be an issue for someone who wishes to stay for only a short period of time. They however were a problem to me who was to stay for [number redacted] days.

It turned out that the nearest train station is at 15 minutes' walk from the house. Google map shows the distance between the house and the train station to be 1.3 kilometers and 16 minutes by walk.

This really infuriates me for a couple of reasons.

1. If staying in a female-only house (or in an unoccupied house) was important to her, it really doesnt seem fair that I should be taking a hit. It is apparent by my profile that I myself am a male and we never gave any indication that their would not be males in this house. We live here.   

2. I dont mean to blow things out of proportion, she is probably concerned about safety, but this is in fact sexism. What if I as a male had written a negative review, stating ""uncomfortable because their were women (or nin-binary) living there""? In any case, this is something I feel she should have investigated before booking if it was crucial to her stay.

,AirBnB,"Hey /r/AirBnB!

So my friends and I have rented out this AirBnB in Canada to stay away from our families during COVID times because we work in the healthcare department. We booked the place for over a month, are 3 days in the reservation and have encounter water leak problems coming from the ceiling in the bathroom making it impossible to use without getting showered with brown water and would love to hear your advice.  We contacted the host yesterday and they said they'll get it fixed the next day (today) we were a bit skeptical as the whole building has ceiling leaks in the bathrooms (we checked with the ones living upstairs and downstairs who have also confirmed the ceiling leaks).

We are looking at 2 options here, either we book an entire new airbnb/go around asking for a refund or should we wait it out and see if it gets fixed? The problem with that, the leaks are getting worse. I have included an IMGUR with photos/videos included for your viewing.

,AirBnB,"Came to a city dealing with COVID under the FEMA relief program. From notice to deployment was 2 days. Had to put up my own money for housing and found, what I thought, would be a decent place to stay for the next month. Arrived and immediately knew it would not work. Not only was it twice as far from the site as they claimed when I asked, but not even in the correct city. More like the border of one city and another, but leaning into the worse of the two. Homeless men fighting in the (very small) parking lot all night and drunk and sleeping next to my car all day. Also, I was the only person in the entire building, so no help if needed in an emergency.

,AirBnB,"I have a large house (2400 sqft, large by my standards lol) in Louisville, KY. It is a 4 bedroom, 1 1/2 br tri level house with another studio apartment above the detached garage in the back. My house is a stone's throw away from Churchill Downs, the airport, and right at the two major highway intersections. In short, it seems like an ideal place to have an Airbnb. I've been thinking about what to do with my house as I want to get out of the city, and Airbnb was one of the paths we considered.

Part of the reason we want to move has largely been based on that the house next door to us is an airbnb. the house is another 4 br and I'm assuming because of this, most of the time when it is booked (which seems like all the time) it is large groups of people. It seems like there is a party happening there just about every week or two. Even with coronavirus nothing has slowed down.

The house was bought to be an Airbnb and for the year+ that it has been, it's miserable being a neighbor. Because of this, part of me wants to do the same just to undercut them. I bought my house 3 years ago and paid almost half of what the owner of the house next door did because my house needed work, most of which is already done. 

Now that the backstory is out of the way I have a few questions about hosting my house and studio full time. With the frequency that next door is occupied in assuming that it's a realistic and profitable option. With that being said, are there good resources to help decide if this is a good path to consider? I have a full time business already and assume a business would have to be established to do this the way Im thinking.

,AirBnB,"We had an Airbnb in Maine from 7/24-8/7. Before arriving in Maine, we had negative tests and quarantined before our arrival in Maine, and have been wearing masks everywhere and regularly washing hands/using hand sanitizer.

Our Airbnb host listed her property on the market for sale two days before our visit, which was the period after we could cancel without penalty. We were asked to accommodate a photographer and showings. We asked that the photographer come before our arrival. After some back and forth, our host finally agreed to get the photography done the afternoon of our arrival.

We were very uncomfortable with the idea of showings, both because of COVID and the hassle of having to plan time away from the house, put our stuff away, have strangers in the house, etc. It doesn’t seem like a reasonable expectation of an Airbnb guest who’s paid thousands of dollars to stay in your home.

Our host pushed us – there was a very keen buyer who wanted to see the house. She promised us the realtor and prospective buyer would be following Maine’s COVID real estate guidelines, which include wearing masks and gloves, minimizing contact with surfaces, and sanitizing surfaces before leaving.

We agreed reluctantly to the showing. We were still unenthused about the prospect, but our host is a nurse, and we didn’t want to stand in the way of her selling the property if she had a prospective buyer.

She seemed miffed we were not willing to accommodate more showings and grew short with us in written communication.

As soon as the house hit the market, we had cars dropping by regularly, with strangers getting out to approach the house and take pictures.

There were times I was home alone at the house. As a young woman, having men on motorcycles drive up to the house (just one of the many incidents) made me uncomfortable. I’m sure the house hunters were all well-meaning and presented little risk, but I was on edge every time I’ve heard a noise outside, jumping when I heard a car door slam or voices at the bottom of the driveway.

A key box appeared on our front door, with no warning from our host or information about who had keys. (There’s one on the back door, which is how we unlocked the house).

On Saturday afternoon (8/1), our friend asked to stop by with his dog (he had been quarantining in New Hampshire for several weeks). We double checked the Airbnb rules for the property and didn’t see a prohibition on dogs, so we thought it would be okay for a visit. We hadn’t planned to bring dogs with us, so it hadn’t been a consideration before booking.

For the majority of the visit, we were out/off the property, and the dog was inside for at most an hour. She is afraid of stairs, so she was only on the wood floors on the main level. Before we left, our friend put out a water bowl and bed for the dog to lay in as we made plans.

We left for a few hours, and when we returned had received a message from the host:

“It has come to my attention that there is an animal at the house. This is direct violation of the house rules and guests expectations as no animals are allowed at the property. The pet must leave the property. I have reached out to Airbnb for further resolution”

We realized then that there were two sets of House Rules:

* Those seen when considering booking, which do have a prohibition on animals; and
* Those we see as guests through the Airbnb app, which did not have a prohibition on animals.

(we have screenshots of both sets of rules)

We were surprised to find the discrepancy and apologized. Our friend left immediately with the dog (within 15 minutes of the message from the host), and we let the host know. She wanted to confirm and said someone would stop by but would not coordinate with us to find a time.

We asked if this could be solved without escalation to Airbnb, especially as we had been accommodating with the listing. Our host responded that while she appreciated our flexibility with showing the home, “which we carefully coordinated, it is entirely unrelated to this concern.”

We spent the next several hours cleaning the downstairs (the only area in which the dog was, which has hardwood floors). The floors were filthy – well beyond what is possible from wear and tear from our visit, especially as we do not wear shoes indoors. We cleared out cobwebs and dust that had been in corners, and vacuumed the couches (the dog was not on any of the furniture). We cleaned more thoroughly than they had been for our visit.

Additionally, we found mouse droppings on the counter and cutting board shortly after our arrival. They were at the counters edge and seemed to have been left after whatever pre-cleaning was done.

We received a message from Airbnb on Sunday that said:

“As you know, the listing was advertised to be a pet-free property which most of the guests in our community who have allergies with pets are booking for. This might be an oversight that you are unaware initially of this house rule but your host is requesting an additional cleaning fee of $200 as the listing have to be deep cleaned after your stay. … Your host would be willing to have you accommodated for the rest of your stay given that the dog is no longer in the listing and the $200 pet fee is paid. Otherwise, we will have to enforce the alteration of your stay for an immediate check out in 24 hours”

We take responsibility for breaking the House Rules (although unintentionally). We understand the need for the cleaning fee – a deep cleaning to accommodate people with pet allergies is necessary and fair.

We were asked to share our perspective, which we sent in the next couple of hours. We were not sent a bill for $200.

Since the incident, I’ve been uneasy by the host’s unknown method of monitoring the house. She contacted us quickly after our friend had spent no substantial time at the property. Undisclosed cameras? Someone peering into the house, seeing the dog bed and water bowl? A neighbor?

The host dropped by unannounced on Monday to inspect the house to ensure there were no animals. She was wearing a mask. I asked if she would wash her hands and wear gloves (complying with the real estate restrictions in place in the state).

She was incredibly hostile and dismissive, saying she’d wash her hands inside and wouldn’t touch anything. My request that she wear gloves was taken as a ludicrous request. We let her in under duress – we were worried our reservation would get canceled or she would take further action against us. She did not wash her hands.

She said that she wouldn't touch anything but touched doorknobs and the bannister and made no effort to disinfect it. She is a nurse, so should know better. She also potentially put us at higher exposure to COVID if she has been working at a hospital or seeing patients. She came within 6 feet of us during her surprise inspection, so was not complying with social distancing restrictions in the state.

Her caviler behavior makes me wonder how careful she/the cleaning crew was in preparing for our visit (beyond what we already know about the filthy floors). We are concerned that the showing and real estate agent was as lax as she was, even though our host assured us that she was following the Maine Real Estate COVID guidelines. We were not present for the showing, so are not sure how it was conducted.

We had been keen to find a resolution. She rebuffed our attempts to coordinate a visit, and our attempts to resolve the situation amicably in both digital and in person communications were met with derision.

Clearly she was pissed at us. We suspect was initially rooted in our refusal to let her show the house multiple times, with the dog situation the cherry on top.

Additionally, the wifi advertised as continuous access in the listing, when in reality it’s slow, subpar wifi that works in only two small rooms. Before we booked, we stressed we needed fast wifi so we could all work remotely, and were assured it would be suitable.

There were other inconveniences of the stay that come with booking a place online &amp; reading a few reviews before doing so – AC only in the bedrooms (neither of the two rooms in which the wifi works), flat tires on the bikes advertised in the description, racoons in the trash, etc. Normally none of these relatively minor issues would have been a problem.

Last night (8/5), we received a message from Airbnb requiring us to leave immediately. This was at 6:00 pm, during the tropical storm. We were left without a place to go and had to drive several hours to family in the rain, with downed trees and power lines. It was a treacherous drive, especially as it became dark. We were lucky to have family within a few hours, so made for there (without having an opportunity for a COVID test or quarantine first, of course).

We have not received communication back from Airbnb, other than a message several hours after we vacated asking if we were somewhere safe. I’ve been sending messages on twitter, to which they responded in a DM asking to confirm the email address, but have otherwise heard nothing.

Any suggestions on how to proceed from here? I’m wary of doing a chargeback as I’ve read some stories about that going wrong.",t2_bgi4f,False,,0,False,Airbnb issues in Maine,[],r/AirBnB,False,6,,0,,False,t3_i4av2u,False,dark,0.75,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1596681083.0,text,6,,,text,self.AirBnB,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had an Airbnb in Maine from 7/24-8/7. Before arriving in Maine, we had negative tests and quarantined before our arrival in Maine, and have been wearing masks everywhere and regularly washing hands/using hand sanitizer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Airbnb host listed her property on the market for sale two days before our visit, which was the period after we could cancel without penalty. We were asked to accommodate a photographer and showings. We asked that the photographer come before our arrival. After some back and forth, our host finally agreed to get the photography done the afternoon of our arrival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were very uncomfortable with the idea of showings, both because of COVID and the hassle of having to plan time away from the house, put our stuff away, have strangers in the house, etc. It doesn’t seem like a reasonable expectation of an Airbnb guest who’s paid thousands of dollars to stay in your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our host pushed us – there was a very keen buyer who wanted to see the house. She promised us the realtor and prospective buyer would be following Maine’s COVID real estate guidelines, which include wearing masks and gloves, minimizing contact with surfaces, and sanitizing surfaces before leaving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We agreed reluctantly to the showing. We were still unenthused about the prospect, but our host is a nurse, and we didn’t want to stand in the way of her selling the property if she had a prospective buyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She seemed miffed we were not willing to accommodate more showings and grew short with us in written communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as the house hit the market, we had cars dropping by regularly, with strangers getting out to approach the house and take pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were times I was home alone at the house. As a young woman, having men on motorcycles drive up to the house (just one of the many incidents) made me uncomfortable. I’m sure the house hunters were all well-meaning and presented little risk, but I was on edge every time I’ve heard a noise outside, jumping when I heard a car door slam or voices at the bottom of the driveway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key box appeared on our front door, with no warning from our host or information about who had keys. (There’s one on the back door, which is how we unlocked the house).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday afternoon (8/1), our friend asked to stop by with his dog (he had been quarantining in New Hampshire for several weeks). We double checked the Airbnb rules for the property and didn’t see a prohibition on dogs, so we thought it would be okay for a visit. We hadn’t planned to bring dogs with us, so it hadn’t been a consideration before booking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the majority of the visit, we were out/off the property, and the dog was inside for at most an hour. She is afraid of stairs, so she was only on the wood floors on the main level. Before we left, our friend put out a water bowl and bed for the dog to lay in as we made plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left for a few hours, and when we returned had received a message from the host:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It has come to my attention that there is an animal at the house. This is direct violation of the house rules and guests expectations as no animals are allowed at the property. The pet must leave the property. I have reached out to Airbnb for further resolution”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We realized then that there were two sets of House Rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those seen when considering booking, which do have a prohibition on animals; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those we see as guests through the Airbnb app, which did not have a prohibition on animals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(we have screenshots of both sets of rules)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were surprised to find the discrepancy and apologized. Our friend left immediately with the dog (within 15 minutes of the message from the host), and we let the host know. She wanted to confirm and said someone would stop by but would not coordinate with us to find a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We asked if this could be solved without escalation to Airbnb, especially as we had been accommodating with the listing. Our host responded that while she appreciated our flexibility with showing the home, “which we carefully coordinated, it is entirely unrelated to this concern.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the next several hours cleaning the downstairs (the only area in which the dog was, which has hardwood floors). The floors were filthy – well beyond what is possible from wear and tear from our visit, especially as we do not wear shoes indoors. We cleared out cobwebs and dust that had been in corners, and vacuumed the couches (the dog was not on any of the furniture). We cleaned more thoroughly than they had been for our visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we found mouse droppings on the counter and cutting board shortly after our arrival. They were at the counters edge and seemed to have been left after whatever pre-cleaning was done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We received a message from Airbnb on Sunday that said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As you know, the listing was advertised to be a pet-free property which most of the guests in our community who have allergies with pets are booking for. This might be an oversight that you are unaware initially of this house rule but your host is requesting an additional cleaning fee of $200 as the listing have to be deep cleaned after your stay. … Your host would be willing to have you accommodated for the rest of your stay given that the dog is no longer in the listing and the $200 pet fee is paid. Otherwise, we will have to enforce the alteration of your stay for an immediate check out in 24 hours”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We take responsibility for breaking the House Rules (although unintentionally). We understand the need for the cleaning fee – a deep cleaning to accommodate people with pet allergies is necessary and fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were asked to share our perspective, which we sent in the next couple of hours. We were not sent a bill for $200.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the incident, I’ve been uneasy by the host’s unknown method of monitoring the house. She contacted us quickly after our friend had spent no substantial time at the property. Undisclosed cameras? Someone peering into the house, seeing the dog bed and water bowl? A neighbor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The host dropped by unannounced on Monday to inspect the house to ensure there were no animals. She was wearing a mask. I asked if she would wash her hands and wear gloves (complying with the real estate restrictions in place in the state).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was incredibly hostile and dismissive, saying she’d wash her hands inside and wouldn’t touch anything. My request that she wear gloves was taken as a ludicrous request. We let her in under duress – we were worried our reservation would get canceled or she would take further action against us. She did not wash her hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said that she wouldn&amp;#39;t touch anything but touched doorknobs and the bannister and made no effort to disinfect it. She is a nurse, so should know better. She also potentially put us at higher exposure to COVID if she has been working at a hospital or seeing patients. She came within 6 feet of us during her surprise inspection, so was not complying with social distancing restrictions in the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her caviler behavior makes me wonder how careful she/the cleaning crew was in preparing for our visit (beyond what we already know about the filthy floors). We are concerned that the showing and real estate agent was as lax as she was, even though our host assured us that she was following the Maine Real Estate COVID guidelines. We were not present for the showing, so are not sure how it was conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had been keen to find a resolution. She rebuffed our attempts to coordinate a visit, and our attempts to resolve the situation amicably in both digital and in person communications were met with derision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly she was pissed at us. We suspect was initially rooted in our refusal to let her show the house multiple times, with the dog situation the cherry on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the wifi advertised as continuous access in the listing, when in reality it’s slow, subpar wifi that works in only two small rooms. Before we booked, we stressed we needed fast wifi so we could all work remotely, and were assured it would be suitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were other inconveniences of the stay that come with booking a place online &amp;amp; reading a few reviews before doing so – AC only in the bedrooms (neither of the two rooms in which the wifi works), flat tires on the bikes advertised in the description, racoons in the trash, etc. Normally none of these relatively minor issues would have been a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night (8/5), we received a message from Airbnb requiring us to leave immediately. This was at 6:00 pm, during the tropical storm. We were left without a place to go and had to drive several hours to family in the rain, with downed trees and power lines. It was a treacherous drive, especially as it became dark. We were lucky to have family within a few hours, so made for there (without having an opportunity for a COVID test or quarantine first, of course).&lt;/p&gt;

There are no links, there&amp;#39;s no button for booking, and Google is returning nothing but the same links, which are all news articles about the program - no information exists on how to get into it. There&amp;#39;s not even a list of the &amp;quot;trusted nonprofit partners&amp;quot; for a referral.&lt;br/&gt;
How do I go about obtaining a booking through this program, so my spouse can have his surgery?&lt;/p&gt;

,AirBnB,"I was traveling and had gotten an AirBnB for 3 months time.  During the second month my landlord showed up at my apartment unannounced and went into the property without permission.  Luckily, I wasn't there as he would of been seen as an intruder.  The Landlord had left his flashlight within my personal belongings and I'm missing items of large value.  When I confronted the landlord and suggested his actions were not wise, he threatened me and illegally told me to leave the premises.  I did not file a criminal report but may now.  

AirBnB promised a refund for my unspent amount and AirBnB was rather receptive.

Then COVID hit, and this became a shit show.

I've been trying to contact AirBnB for over 4 months now.  They respond that they need to escalate my ticket, but then I hear nothing from them.

I've since disputed the transaction.  AirBnB had fought me on it, and it took 3 months to get my decision which was in my favor.  I withdrew the money and closed that credit card.  AirBnB had still not returned or responded any of my enquirers.

The entire process has cost me around 16-24 hours.

Turns out, AirBnB just sent a NEW charge to my closed account for the month in question.  The Credit Card account is closed, but it now shows its entirety on my statement.  I've disputed it again, and tried to contact AirBnB, but only get the same ""we've escalated message"".  I tried to tell the person who redirected me that I've contacted them many times before and they keep escalating it then not responding.  They now are no longer responding and I've heard nothing from them (again).

I'm currently looking for a Lawyer and am contemplating a civil action law suit for damages sustained due to their ridiculousness and inability to meet what they said they would do in writing.  I'm also going to look for compensation for the time spent and lost items.  I'm now stuck with MORE work trying to clear this from my credit card and am afraid it will hit my credit.

Looking for a lawyer who will help sue AirBnB if they do not stop this crap within a week and refund the entire month lost.

,AirBnB,"Whoa, where do I start. I just need to get this off my chest this has been the most aweful, experience I have personally ever had with AirBnB. As a reputed company I expected... so so so much more. For the readers who want a quick story, I sat on dried human feces at a AirBnB that was advertised as a Superhost and Sanitized then they blackmailed us, and now I'm on hold for the second time after going through 3 dispatches.... 

Now for the details..;To begin with Me and My boyfriend wanted to do a couples retreat... just for a few days away from home which we have been cooped up for all of the last few months.. We were going to just access a few parks and be safe and wear masks... but it was still a trip we looked forwards to as the pandemic has had us feeling like bears in hibernation mode.

We booked the AirBnB a week or two in advance, and we had been really looking forwards to it. The AirBnB was advertised as Superhost, and Sanitized. The reviews on the AirBnB were spectacular and so we had our hopes up. As newbies to the AirBnB platform we have had only great experiences with it so... we expected nothing less.

Everything was as normal, our check-in time was set as 3 pm as we were told that they had a guest in the suite before us and they needed time to clean. We were told to come no earlier than 3pm and we complied to their wishes. We really appreciated that as we are still in the midst of a global pandemic the host was taking into attention to clean the AirBnB.

We walked into the AirBnB and I could not have been happier, It was beautiful, as advertised there were many amenities and the space was very cozy and sweet and cute to the naked eye. ... Only if I had known the horrors that were to ensue afterwords I would have turned on my camera and hightailed it out of there.

We had a busy day planned, we wanted to go to a few gardens and parks and greenhouses and such. This is a beautiful city and I love the outdoors. We had even had a drive in movie booked as well as dinner so... we were just there to check in at the agreed time and leave... 

We decided to use the washroom before we headed out for the day as we normally would and I went in first. As someone who is skeptical of public washrooms and more trusting of home I really had to go and without even a second thought as soon as i opened the lid i sat down and did my business. Yes, stupid I know, I am not the brightest bulb in the room. I got up and noticed a black fluff the size of my thumbnail on the seat right where it connects to the lid. I repeat. On the seat. so when i leaned back after sitting down I 100% touched it. but thinking it is fluff off my clothes or something, as we can be blinded by our minds I took a piece of toilet paper and bent down to pick it up, to just flush it or throw it out. While bending down to pick it up. I realised. this was not fluff.. this was a dried up human feces the size of my fingernail with the trail of poop juice from where it first landed. 

Now, I... I full on panic cleaned it. I freaked out cleaned the feces off the toilet seat flushed it and then I wiped the seat with multiple applications of handsoap and toilet paper, I freaked out and did a quick freak-out wipe of myself with soap and water using the sink. Honestly that event is a bit of a blur i had been very very panicked. However, a part of my mind realised, we had plans that day and I went into autopilot. I cleaned and then I left the washroom. Told my boyfriend of what happened and we did a second inspection of the toilet not just the seat which i thoroughly cleaned, there was a dried pee streak from the toilet to the floor where where was a hair attached to it the folding area between the lid and seat had urine imbedded in it and behind the toilet the little cap area was clearly with dried urine and was black. It ... was disgusting. We cleaned the toilet on the areas that we would touch if we were to use it and we lysoled it. We naively decided to try to just get air and try to enjoy our day. I buried my disgust and just hoped for a shower when we got back. 

In hindsight... we were naive.. and honestly stupid. We got back around 12 am and I got undressed to hop in the shower. When we opened  the shower door I realised once more that it had not been cleaned... there was hair.. everywhere. And to make matters worse, there was green mucus on the floor of the shower. I broke. I knew I had to shower, because sitting on the feces had honestly bothered me all day... but I couldn't mentally handle stepping into the shower which had someone else's mucus in it in the middle of a global pandemic.

My boyfriend, bless his heart tried to make me feel better by cleaning the shower and lysoling it himself. So that I could take the shower. But it had already passed the threshold for me where I could emotionally contain myself. I broke down. This was a vacation i had been looking forwards to for a very long time. I had not expected to clean up feces, or mucus of another human being in the middle of  a pandemic, at a ""superhost""'s house that had been advertised as Sanitized. I broke. Mind you, this might not be  a big deal for some people, but I'm a student with a min wage job, cleaning toilets unfortunately is part of the job, I had been looking forwards to a Vacation, which was supposed to be a fresh breath away from the min-wage service industry job ive been working in, so i can scrape by school. 

Honestly, I just broke, i was catatonically standing in front of the shower due to the three thoughts ""I have to shower i sat on shit, The shower had mucus and what else i don't want to shower, I have to shower my boyfriend cleaned it"" I stood there for a solid 10 minutes, as my boyfriend tried to get other things clean, but when he saw my state... he dropped everything and decided we were not spending the night there.

We ended up renting at a different inn for the night ( which wasn't much better ) and while running out we texted the host the information and the state of the washroom. First we got a offer for a 50% of return, and when they realised we weren't staying the night they offered a 100% return minus the AirBnB fees. 

Due to the fact that we are in the  middle of the pandemic, we decided to call customer support anyways. after 20 min wait and a talk with a dispatcher we were told AirBnB will contact us and that we will be prioritized.

Fast forward a few hours we ended up booking the second night at a nearby Bed and Breakfast away from the city ( we were supposed to stay at Air BnB for 2 nights) . ... Then we got a text from the landlord, "" he will send half of the rent now, and other half (minus the Air BnB costs) after we provided them with a good review .. and only then will he also provide us with a good customer review "" 

We were appalled. Now, the host was going back on his initial statement of the full return and further more threatening us with a bad customer review! We called Air BnB, talked to another dispatcher, and he waited with us until we got contacted with a case manager. Around that time another dispatcher called my boyfriend's phone, and he was on hold for a case manager. When we got hold of the case manager. After about 1 hour of being put on hold, the call dropped. We ... were upset. Because now we had collectively spent about 3-4 hours on the phone and about 8 hours standby waiting for a call.... we tried calling again talked to a 4rth dispatcher and he put us on hold... for about another hour... then the call dropped. ... Needless to say... we are .. very very very upset...

,AirBnB,"Hi guys and gals,

Was looking for some other perspectives on a frustrating incident i had with Airbnb last weekend.

Me and a big group went to rent out a cottage. The host listed the place under full house but actually had a tenant living in the basement who is given the whole left side of the driveway.

She reassured us though, saying we can park on the street no problem.

Well, apparently city rules changed (that weekend) due to covid and she wasnt aware of it.

We got fined over 200$.

I believe the host should pay this fine. Airbnb and the host arent really budging and only offering to pay a total of 75$.

,AirBnB,"I don't even know where to start. I'm an emotional wreck. I don't know where else to go but dive into this community, the Reddit family, that I've been a silent part of for what feels like forever. Never thought I'd ever post, much less about something as awful as this. Oh, where to begin...

My family and I have been active users (as guests) and supporters of AirBnB for a few years. We had only great experiences and befriended the sweetest and kindest hosts to exist. I trusted AirBnB with myself, and with my family. And that all took a crash today. 

I recommended that my mother, sister and brother, who were going to visit my old, dying grandmother overseas, to book a place for a month with AirBnB. All our past experiences with AirBnB has been either a few days per host, a week max. So this would be a first. The country they were going to finally opened their borders and my mother, also an emotional wreck resulting from months of watching my grandma decay via video (from old age, not coronavirus), was doubtful but I convinced her to book this place that had a couple of positive reviews. She wasn't a super-host by any means, but she had reviews and several apartments and the last minute dates added up. It was a match made in heaven, I was convinced. The host spoke very sweetly and was close in age to me (in her twenties). She was managing the building as the AirBnB host, she didn't own it. Anyway... I found her and told my family to book her and that I'd reimburse them because money is tight rather than them bunking with a distant relative who had no WiFi or AC and only one bedroom with roaches. 

Prior to booking, we wanted to confirm several of the amenities/utilities that were mentioned. Mainly, the AC and the WiFi. My sister worked remotely and that would be their only source of income so an internet connection wasn't something they were willing to compromise. The host confirmed (and we have screenshots of the messages she shared via the app) that there was indeed WiFi, even if not the fastest speed. We were okay with that. WiFi would also be our only means of communication, between me in the States and them abroad. 

After confirming the reservation, I obtained her number and we exchanged whatsapp messages that are still available to this day. In this exchange were voice notes where she eased my fears of being separated from my mother: mainly, my mom going off to a country that was basically foreign to them (even though ethnically connected, we never lived there) much less with this pandemic suddenly closing borders across the globe. She told me that she would ""place my mother in her eye"" which in this specific country means that my mother would be the ""apple of her eye"" and she would go above and beyond for her. I naively took her for her word and the next day, my family flew out. Fast-forward to them getting settled into the apartment later that day (much past the check-in time, but whatever). She first tells them that her printer ""ran out of paper"" so she can't provide them with the contract that they had to sign with all the rules, etc. Then in the actual apartment, the first thing they notice is: surprise surprise, there's no WiFi. In the living room is a five foot radius where they can just barely catch some connection to get in contact with me. I learn that the entire building of apartments is empty. The apartment above them has the modem but it's too far and weak to reach anywhere else. We immediately contact the host (again, there are receipts) and inform her very politely of the issue. She reassures us that because it's a holiday that day, she'll find someone to come transfer it downstairs the next day. The concierge, a kind young man, allowed my brother to sit in the apartment upstairs to use the WiFi during the day, but it usually got too hot to bear because there's no AC up there. This will all soon change. 

For context: They arrived Wednesday. Thursday comes and goes. Friday comes and goes. Friday, I tried to contact AirBnB. I tried to call them, since I'm in the States, but I'm left waiting for over 20 minutes. I send them messages. No response. My sister is missing shifts and is afraid to lose her job. Her boss is severely annoyed with her. I can barely speak to them because if anyone steps out of the tiny corner that catches glimpses of bad WiFi, all service disappears, and it's a two bedroom apartment. Saturday comes. They're desperate to get the issue resolved before Monday. So we all contact the host again, and also the owner of the building because his number is also provided on AirBnB. That day, the concierge shows my brother voice notes of the host shouting at him. She tells him: ""Do not allow anyone upstairs to use the internet. If that ""good-for-nothing"" family talks to you, ignore them. If they need help, do not help them. They had the audacity to go ""over my head"" and complain so we are not helping them or doing anything for them"". (When in fact, they said nothing personal about her at all and still felt like there was a good relationship between them and the host, they just wanted the issue resolved professionally and he was the owner). Monday shows up and my sister misses her shift again. She's almost certain that she's lost her job at that point, and was going to start looking into buying an internet SIM even though money is tight to try and salvage the situation. My aunt and cousin (who came the day before from another country to also see my grandma for a few days) decide to go to my mom and convince her to confront the host at her office. And that's when shit really hits the fan. This happened today, Monday, August 3rd, 2020, not even a week into their month long lease.

The host is immediately hostile and aggressive. My aunt, at one point, takes out her phone to record when the host starts shouting. This angers her even more and she storms to the door, holds it open, and tells them to leave. Or in her words, ""go kiss the pavement"". They refuse and ask to talk, but she won't hear it. Keep in mind, she looks to be no older than 25/26 and it all looks like a child throwing a tantrum. She, the host, begins to screech (literally. it's terrifying) and briefly charges at my aunt to try and take the phone away. When she fails, she runs outside on the street and starts to shout ""THEY'RE TRYING TO HIT ME, THESE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO ASSAULT ME"". Almost everyone ignores her. She returns inside and pulls out her phone and says she's also recording. Then she goes back outside to scream for help. At this point, she is literally screeching inhumanly, insulting and threatening to bring the police. It's quite scary to watch. Towards the end, she just screams, no words, and starts to wave her hands violently and aggressively kicks a chair. This is all caught on my aunt's phone, in a 3 minute and 33 seconds long video. A man intervenes and says that they should leave, that clearly the girl lost her mind and they should just go. They do. Almost immediately, she begins the online harassment. 

She texts my mother, telling her that she will bring the cops to their door to drag them out. That she will cancel the reservation and they will receive no refund. Bear in mind, she knows that my grandmother who is extremely ill and in diapers is residing with them and my mother is alone, the sole caretaker. My brother is a teenager and my sister barely speaks the language, so all responsibility falls on my 60+ ill mother. My aunt and cousin leave (who she, the host, had the most beef with because they were confrontational and my mother isn't, she's too soft spoken) and she, the host, says that by tomorrow morning, she better not find them in the apartment. She continues to send messages and threaten throughout the night. I am in shambles. I'm currently trying to move out of my apartment in New York before my landlord goes ape-shit on me because two moving companies flaked after my husband and I paid the deposit so we're stuck with all our furniture 4 days post the end of our lease, but that is a whole other story. Basically, I'm already a ball of nerves and stress. And guilt. I had priorly contacted AirBnB about the WiFi problem on July 31st which was in the 48-hour window of the contract. No one bothered to respond. I then called them again today after my family informed me of the traumatic events they had to publicly endure and finally got someone on the line after 10+ minutes of waiting.

How do I describe his demeanor? He was... cold. As I was explaining, he didn't react or express any emotion, care or empathy. I start to cry and it was evident in my voice because I get really shaky, and his only response after telling him basically a summary of everything I wrote above was: ""That's a customer support issue so I'll send over the info and mark it urgent. Anything else?"" I felt so hopeless, upset and betrayed. I genuinely believed that they would help, offer some assurance that my family would be okay and relocated for example. Or that they would be reimbursed, it was nearly a thousand dollars. I thought that they would help solve the issue, reprimand that host and make sure this never happens again to my family or anyone else. But I got NOTHING. That call happened 8 hours ago. Since then, I have received a grand total of \*zero\* messages, calls or e-mails from anyone. Nothing. I tried calling again, but no answer after being on hold for 20+ minutes. So I'm currently sitting on the floor of the half empty apartment I was supposed to have left today bawling my eyes out, unable to communicate with my mother and sister, unknowing of what hell that demon host is going to make them go through in a few hours (their Tues morning). 

So here I am. Upset, hurt and angry. I have the video. I didn't want to make it public, I told the guy who answered me when I called AirBnB that I didn't want to post the video anywhere and just wanted to send it to them privately, but he didn't care to comment on it. So, now I feel the urge to upload it to YouTube or something because I don't feel heard and this is serious, these are lives being affected. This is not right. My family doesn't deserve this. I tried talking to the host, I sent messages and a voice note, I was in tears and told her just have some humanity. I don't know where to put my family on such short notice and an extremely tight budget. We had a month contract. I didn't have energy to be angry at her. I never cursed her out, threatened her, or was disorderly in any way. Neither were my mother and sister. My aunt and cousin were firm and tough, but they also didn't insult or screech at her. She also claims that she will ""act legally"" about the video recording my aunt took of her and wants to get her ""imprisoned for 2 years"" because she says in that country, recording someone against their will is illegal, even though she also pulled out her phone to record at one point and also mentioned that the security cameras were recording everything. I don't want revenge, I just want a solution. If I don't get one, I want to upload the video and the receipts, including the first name of the host, and share my story because even if my situation doesn't resolve, no one should ever do business with that host and be more wary of AirBnB because there is truly NO customer support or care.",t2_7gyflmcn,False,,0,False,Monster Host - Public Abuse,[],r/AirBnB,False,6,,0,,False,t3_i3akps,False,dark,0.5,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1596535198.0,text,6,,,text,self.AirBnB,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t even know where to start.

My aunt and cousin (who came the day before from another country to also see my grandma for a few days) decide to go to my mom and convince her to confront the host at her office. And that&amp;#39;s when shit really hits the fan. This happened today, Monday, August 3rd, 2020, not even a week into their month long lease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The host is immediately hostile and aggressive. My aunt, at one point, takes out her phone to record when the host starts shouting. This angers her even more and she storms to the door, holds it open, and tells them to leave. Or in her words, &amp;quot;go kiss the pavement&amp;quot;. They refuse and ask to talk, but she won&amp;#39;t hear it. Keep in mind, she looks to be no older than 25/26 and it all looks like a child throwing a tantrum. She, the host, begins to screech (literally. it&amp;#39;s terrifying) and briefly charges at my aunt to try and take the phone away. When she fails, she runs outside on the street and starts to shout &amp;quot;THEY&amp;#39;RE TRYING TO HIT ME, THESE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO ASSAULT ME&amp;quot;. Almost everyone ignores her. She returns inside and pulls out her phone and says she&amp;#39;s also recording. Then she goes back outside to scream for help. At this point, she is literally screeching inhumanly, insulting and threatening to bring the police. It&amp;#39;s quite scary to watch. Towards the end, she just screams, no words, and starts to wave her hands violently and aggressively kicks a chair. This is all caught on my aunt&amp;#39;s phone, in a 3 minute and 33 seconds long video. A man intervenes and says that they should leave, that clearly the girl lost her mind and they should just go. They do. Almost immediately, she begins the online harassment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She texts my mother, telling her that she will bring the cops to their door to drag them out. That she will cancel the reservation and they will receive no refund. Bear in mind, she knows that my grandmother who is extremely ill and in diapers is residing with them and my mother is alone, the sole caretaker. My brother is a teenager and my sister barely speaks the language, so all responsibility falls on my 60+ ill mother. My aunt and cousin leave (who she, the host, had the most beef with because they were confrontational and my mother isn&amp;#39;t, she&amp;#39;s too soft spoken) and she, the host, says that by tomorrow morning, she better not find them in the apartment. She continues to send messages and threaten throughout the night. I am in shambles. I&amp;#39;m currently trying to move out of my apartment in New York before my landlord goes ape-shit on me because two moving companies flaked after my husband and I paid the deposit so we&amp;#39;re stuck with all our furniture 4 days post the end of our lease, but that is a whole other story. Basically, I&amp;#39;m already a ball of nerves and stress. And guilt. I had priorly contacted AirBnB about the WiFi problem on July 31st which was in the 48-hour window of the contract. No one bothered to respond. I then called them again today after my family informed me of the traumatic events they had to publicly endure and finally got someone on the line after 10+ minutes of waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I describe his demeanor? He was... cold. As I was explaining, he didn&amp;#39;t react or express any emotion, care or empathy. I start to cry and it was evident in my voice because I get really shaky, and his only response after telling him basically a summary of everything I wrote above was: &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s a customer support issue so I&amp;#39;ll send over the info and mark it urgent. Anything else?&amp;quot; I felt so hopeless, upset and betrayed. I genuinely believed that they would help, offer some assurance that my family would be okay and relocated for example. Or that they would be reimbursed, it was nearly a thousand dollars. I thought that they would help solve the issue, reprimand that host and make sure this never happens again to my family or anyone else. But I got NOTHING. That call happened 8 hours ago. Since then, I have received a grand total of *zero* messages, calls or e-mails from anyone. Nothing. I tried calling again, but no answer after being on hold for 20+ minutes. So I&amp;#39;m currently sitting on the floor of the half empty apartment I was supposed to have left today bawling my eyes out, unable to communicate with my mother and sister, unknowing of what hell that demon host is going to make them go through in a few hours (their Tues morning). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here I am. Upset, hurt and angry. I have the video. I didn&amp;#39;t want to make it public, I told the guy who answered me when I called AirBnB that I didn&amp;#39;t want to post the video anywhere and just wanted to send it to them privately, but he didn&amp;#39;t care to comment on it. So, now I feel the urge to upload it to YouTube or something because I don&amp;#39;t feel heard and this is serious, these are lives being affected. This is not right. My family doesn&amp;#39;t deserve this. I tried talking to the host, I sent messages and a voice note, I was in tears and told her just have some humanity. I don&amp;#39;t know where to put my family on such short notice and an extremely tight budget. We had a month contract. I didn&amp;#39;t have energy to be angry at her. I never cursed her out, threatened her, or was disorderly in any way. Neither were my mother and sister. My aunt and cousin were firm and tough, but they also didn&amp;#39;t insult or screech at her. She also claims that she will &amp;quot;act legally&amp;quot; about the video recording my aunt took of her and wants to get her &amp;quot;imprisoned for 2 years&amp;quot; because she says in that country, recording someone against their will is illegal, even though she also pulled out her phone to record at one point and also mentioned that the security cameras were recording everything. I don&amp;#39;t want revenge, I just want a solution. If I don&amp;#39;t get one, I want to upload the video and the receipts, including the first name of the host, and share my story because even if my situation doesn&amp;#39;t resolve, no one should ever do business with that host and be more wary of AirBnB because there is truly NO customer support or care.&lt;/p&gt;

,AirBnB,"A couple weeks ago we had a stay, out of state, for a family reunion. The owners are out of country residents who were out of the country at the time of booking. They were pretty close to where the family reunion was in an area with very few options. We booked only 2 weeks prior to the dates because of the uncertainty surrounding corona virus. The house was perfect. Clean, well maintained, etc. The first day, the owner decided to come visit and tell us the rules (we had already received, agreed to and abided by) after we had already checked in. We found out that they had decided to come do the cleaning prior to our arrival instead of paying someone else and got “stuck” here due to quarantines. They decided to stay in a trailer(not a camping trailer) on the neighbors property instead of just offering a refund and canceling the stay. They were within site of the property where they were staying. The second day, both owners were in the garage doing who knows what, for quite a while. The third day, they moved my boat which was legally parked on a public beach without my permission. In fact, they moved it out to a bouy where I couldn’t have accessed it without my nephew being able to paddle board out to it. They said they wanted to be helpful but left the key on in the boat and killed my battery. Fortunately, I have a back up battery or it could have been a bigger deal. After that my sister, who had rented the Airbnb with us, found the owners, again at the property and asked them to not come back and if they touched my boat again we would call law enforcement.

Clean, well maintained, etc. The first day, the owner decided to come visit and tell us the rules (we had already received, agreed to and abided by) after we had already checked in. We found out that they had decided to come do the cleaning prior to our arrival instead of paying someone else and got “stuck” here due to quarantines. They decided to stay in a trailer(not a camping trailer) on the neighbors property instead of just offering a refund and canceling the stay. They were within site of the property where they were staying. The second day, both owners were in the garage doing who knows what, for quite a while. The third day, they moved my boat which was legally parked on a public beach without my permission. In fact, they moved it out to a bouy where I couldn’t have accessed it without my nephew being able to paddle board out to it. They said they wanted to be helpful but left the key on in the boat and killed my battery. Fortunately, I have a back up battery or it could have been a bigger deal. After that my sister, who had rented the Airbnb with us, found the owners, again at the property and asked them to not come back and if they touched my boat again we would call law enforcement. Is this anywhere near normal behavior? We had a peaceful rest of the stay, 2 more days, but we’re constantly worried about our stuff after that. Are we just better off at hotels because both myself and my sister weren’t very please. To us, if you rent a property out, you leave. We payed very good money for this property and we definitely aren’t the Karen type.&lt;/p&gt;

,AirBnB,"Had a lady book our place. At first they wanted to check in early, well it was still being cleaned and they had already shown up anyways saying they were out hiking in the area. So we had the cleaning finish up. An hour later they message and said they are getting eaten up by bugs and it itches so much. So I went out there offering to check on them and she said was okay with it. I come to the door, she is barely wearing anything but a towel loosely covering herself. Anyways, I ask where they were bitten. It was a couple bumps on her ankles so I confirmed they said they had went hiking.. Anyways, I looked around everywhere and there is no signs of bugs at all. Being as sympathetic as possible, I let them know that maybe it will get better, that maybe just got it earlier in the day and can let us know.

So a few hours pass and it is evening now and they again message about bugs eating them up that it is so itchy, can't handle it. We expressed that it is probably from them going hiking as we have never had bugs at our location, but that we can call a pest control to check it out. She said she went to the doctor and said she was having an allergic reaction and needed medicine. We were extremely skeptical at this point and just asked to see what medicine she was given. She sent a random picture of a medicine bottle online and I looked at it and it was a doctor even from a different state altogether. She then complained they were coming from the refrigerator.. At this point I realized this lady is a liar and might just be using the place temporarily and trying to get away to use it for free.. They said they would leave but they want a full refund. We tried to help them with whatever issue they wanted, but at this point I wanted to just wash my hands up them and move on.. so we ended up agreeing to give a refund if they leave... so thankfully they left around 11pm and we refunded.

Went out the next morning.. absolutely no bugs as normal. Nothing by the fridge. Just a few random beer cans laying around and more beer in the trash and the place was a mess.

So there is this two story Cottage style house a little down from me in the little holiday beach town i live in its a 3 Bedroom, 2 Bath, Dual Garage Property on 645m2.  The owners come down around once a year towards christmas for around a week before leaving again, since my neighbour turned his old redbrick house into an airbnb late last year the house gets atleast 2 groups or familys staying in their home per week consistently. Has anyone here or does anyone know anyone that has approached a property owner of a holiday home and offered to rent it out on airbnb for the time the family isnt holidaying and manage it so both the property owner and myself get a cut of the revenue made from people staying with no expense or disturbance to the owner as all work would be completed by me as i know it would be a way for me to make some cash due to amount of people staying in my neigbours house.

I tried looking into it online but i couldnt seem to find anyone out there who has tried to do this or has activley done it but im sure there are people who have.

I am really just a first time Airbnber trying to figure out how things work. Thanks a lot to everyone who advised me/gave me their opinion in the comments :)

Hello,
My boyfriend and I booked our first Airbnb for 3 nights. The place was nice, but a few things were not mentioned in the description and other things were just sort of bad. Here are all the things I can think of, please tell me which ones are worth mentionning. I know there are a lot of hosts on this thread, and I am not trying to be a difficult guest or leave them an awful review, since I noticed most reviews are very very short and only positive.

It is not mentioned that:
- There is a third host, whom is the one who communicates with the guests. The ones that own the place on Airbnb only send automated messages.
- The unit is located on the second floor.

 Here is the good:
- The third host responded quickly and nicely, which was very reassuring.
- There is nearly every cleaning product provided.
- Location very very nice, not too loud, close to many things in walking distance.
- The closet is very big, although not many clothe hangers are provided.

Here is the bad (which obviously is also not mentioned but may be temporary or incidental):
- 3 blinds are missing in front of the bed on the pillow side, so lots of light come through as soon as the sun comes up.
- There is no detergent or softener (which we wanted to use since only two towels are provided). The washer and dryer are quite loud.
- One pair of pillows has cases, the other does not.
- There is no hot water in the kitchen sink, only the bathroom. Also very very little cutlery (2 forks, 3 spoons and 2 knives).
- The AC is capped at 65°F and can only be overrid for a set amount of time.
- Night desks are very small and the bedroom has a carpet floor.
- There were flies in the unit when we arrived and cigarette butts on the balcony.

The key to the elevator sometimes does not work, and there is a workaround we only learned about on our second day and after getting stuck outside several times. This was not the hosts’ fault but was still a stressful yet easily solvable issue. I mention in the private note that theh should add this workaround in the check-in instructions for future incidents.

,AirBnB,"I was looking for somewhen in Bulgaria to stay for 3 months that would have spa facility access. I found a few places, did some investigation, and settled on one. I asked this host on two separate occasions if his apartment on a hotel complex included access to their spa facilities. He confirmed twice that it did, so I booked. I paid the first instalment of 550 euros. 

Next day I wanted to find out more about the hotel so I emailed them, only to find out that the hotel will be closed for 2 of the 3 months I'm staying there and so I wouldn't have access to the spa facilities. I presumed it was an innocent mistake on behalf of the host and so I asked to cancel the booking and receive a refund (he had the 30 day cancellation policy), but he refused! I couldn't believe! 

I have messaged the airbnb support and they are investigating, although they've already told me that it's not a situation where they themselves would refund me. I'm not sure on the best course of action. If I change my dates (which it seems he would need to agree to) then I'll end up paying a lot more for the one month since I got a discount on the 3 months, but I don't want to stay for 3 months because I won't have what I have paid for (he has other places much cheaper and more spacious but without the spa facilities). 

It just seems like a bullshit situation where I am going to either pay for something I won't get or lose money for someone else's dishonesty, and my only recourse is that I can leave an honest review to warn future bookers... which is right, and I will, but it hardly compensates my own situation. 

I'm fairly new to airbnb so maybe I'm missing something. Can anyone offer some guidance or advice? I don't want to push hard at the host because I might end up staying in his place and I don't want to find a horses head in my bed one morning, you know?

I feel unsafe with the weird lock situation.

They rented an attached guest house and no issues until checkout. 45 minutes before checkout time they said they ran out of toilet paper.

,AirBnB,"Hello everyone. I've combed this site looking for anything that might help but as it turns out there are lots of covid related cancellation posts and I cannot find anything helpful. Please if anyone can assist I would be grateful. I'm sorry this is long, I will try to simplify.

In Dec '18 I booked a family vacation through Airbnb. I paid half down ~$900 and the other half was due to go through in April, which was fine. Several months later, I dropped my old bank (Chase) for a local bank when I bought a house. Being busy with a house purchase etc., I forgot that the second half of that amount was due to hit in April as an auto transaction through that same Chase account and was declined. Trip was cancelled due to that.

The host allowed a full refund for the first half, but I could not change the account that the money would be refunded to. Support said that it must be refunded to the same account that I booked through. I said that account does not exist. They said then it will ""ping"" back once it is declined and we will send a check. 

Well it never ""pinged"" back. According to Airbnb, the refund was accepted by Chase, and they provided me with ""Bank ARN"" numbers to prove this. Closed my case. I took this information to Chase bank (who no longer has any vested concern with my issues) via customer service and played a back and forth, explaining the situation more times than I would like. Finally they said they would investigate and call me back. 

I received a check in the mail in August 2019 from chase for the full amount, pending the results of the investigation. When I called to clarify, I learned that they had assumed this was a fraudulent charge claim that I was disputing, despite all my explanations. I did not dare cash this check which was good because they sent me a notice later that month telling me that they found there were no fraudulent charges, and would be removing that amount from my account. That no longer exists. (I still have the check just in case that gets hairy.)

At this point, I went to the local Chase office and spoke with their bank manager, who kindly got Chase's appropriate customer service person on the phone who said these numbers mean nothing, either they do not exist or they don't even know what ARN#s are, I don't remember which. Basically, they had no money, neither evident with the ARNs or hidden my non existent account. He also spoke with Airbnb who said it absolutely did go through, but they needed a representative from chase to put their claim that it had not in writing, complete with the dates, amounts refunded, my card number, the ARNs and on official bank paper.

I did this, got it from the bank manager, sent it to them, and received notice back from Airbnb that the person sending this was not official enough. Problem is, I can't get through to customer service to anyone else without spending hours a day on the phone, re-explaining this story, only to get nowhere as I have so many times this far.

I let this issue go for a bit out of exasperation and Covid but now I could really use my $900. It's my money. I considered small claims court but read that I must go to the courts in the jurisdiction where they are located, which would be CA if I'm not mistaken? I'm in Ohio. A plane ticket costs $900 to get there and back. Also, the burden of proof lies with me. If I take them to SCC, and they show these mysterious ARN numbers as proof, the court might find for them and tell me to take Chase to SCC. 

HELP.  $900 is a lot of money for me, particularly right now. I don't know what else to do. Airbnb has closed my case. I have two years to go to SCC. If I hire a lawyer, I would spend that much in legal fees and there is no saying I would even win to reclaim them.

,AirBnB,"I'd like to do this, as I live in a popular holiday area, and so it makes sense for me. Of course I need to clear this with the landlord first.

I understand their risk profile of their house is low risk, but airbnb is a high risk activity, in their mind. How can I assure them? Has anyone out there ever done ok with this discussion?

I figure the major issue is their insurance, ie. getting them to add airbnb to their policy. My major risk would be a fire caused by a guest which insurance does not cover.

,AirBnB,"Hi all,   


I'm planning on purchasing an investment property which I will also use with my family a few weeks a year (renting the rest of the year). It's about a 12 hr drive from our primary home. 

What are your thoughts on rental companies? I don't mind managing my own property but I know being remote there are things I just can't do (like show up and replace bulbs etc).  Management companies are great and make it ""easy"" but the 25% cut is steep imo.

I rented my house for 6 months before and became a superhost and it was pretty simple, but I had a neighbor that came over a handful of times to do things like let someone in that locked themselves out and let a contractor in when our A/C needed to be repaired. 

If you host remotely and manage it yourself, has that worked out well for you? I think the biggest thing I would need is a regular, reliable, and keen-eyed cleaning crew to make sure that when we turned over guests they spotted any problems, etc. And some contractors obviously for when something needs addressing quickly.

,AirBnB,"We are planning a trip as a group of people.

The person who is in charge of booking our accommodation contacted a host on Abnb and after some conversation got a link which looked like this:

abnb.me/3NP  and some more numbers behind it

He forwarded the link to everyone to discuss the legitimacy of this link since we have no experience with Abnb before.

This is the part where I messed up. I wanted to find out what the process is, so I clicked on the link, which brought me to a page that showed a form in need to fill out. I entered my personal information like name, last name, phone, address etc. and filled out the form.

Then after clicking a button, which I forgot what it was called, the site loaded to the [next page](https://imgur.com/a/vgBu98R) which showed the invoice.

On that page it there is a ""View Invoice"" button, which would open a pdf file, in it, there is instructions on how the payment should be made.

The top right of the pdf file has [this](https://imgur.com/a/rlGzlNh), on the third page, I can find the payment details:

Bank name – K&amp;H BANK

Account name – Airbnb LT

Bank address – 1095 BUDAPEST, LECHNER ODON FASOR 9

And other info like, IBAN and BIC

under there is this line:

You must use [www.transferwise.com](http://www.transferwise.com) to complete your payment using your Credit Card and select to complete your payment using your Credit Card and select there the option to pay to our bank account.

I am being quite skeptical since the host seem to be somehow shady. At the time when we found the accommodation, the house has no reviews, and the host's profile was empty.

After my friend sent her an email stating our interest, she requested a payment for the security deposit.

One day after, she sent us the link to fill out for the booking process. However, after I clicked on it to check what it was, it also showed underneath that the house now has 10 5-star reviews.

Am I just being overly cautious since this is my first time booking with Abnb, or does something really look off here?

Edit: I'm very sure that last I checked her profile it said join July 2020, and now its July 2012, something really seems fishy

,AirBnB,"Cross-posted from VRBO.  Minor rental agreement violation (unintentional) = prompt eviction and no refund.

We rented an VRBO this past weekend for 3 nights. Capacity is 12 guests, but because we stated 10 in the reservation when we booked it nearly a year ago, the owner held it at that. The first night only 5 people stayed and the rest came up the next morning. We did end up with 12 guests plus a few visitors who stopped in to say 'hi' for a short while as they were also staying in town.

When reserving the unit, whether you specify 1 or 12 people in VRBO - the rental rate doesn't change - so his claim of rent is per person wasn't accurate. But this guy felt that he could tack on $50/person per night over the 10 guests anyway so we were confused as to how many guests / visitors we could actually have. In my mind a guest is a person who's staying there - not visiting for a short while. This was not clear in the rental agreement.

The rental, which is actually a really nice place, is in back of a liquor store he owns with cameras on the doors to the unit - including one pointing out back to the patio / firepit area which is part of the rental so he could see (and proably hear) everything we were doing back there - and never disclosed this to us or in the agreement. The liquor store (also owned by the host) was keeping tabs on the number of people coming and going using these cameras.

Long story short, the owner said we had too many guests in violation of the rental agreement (which wasn't actually signed or explicitly agreed to) - promptly evicted us and called the police. The rental agreement states he can do this at his sole discretion without a refund.

Other than the confusion about the number of guests and the people who stopped in to say 'hi' - no other issues. But while trying to clarify it with him - he decided he didn't want to discuss it and told us to leave and called the police. No arguing, no raised voices.

Needless to say our weekend was totally ruined and being a popular destination town in the mountains the only place we could find was some run-down motel who went out of their way to accommodate us.

What recourse do we have to recoup our money? We would like to see the entire weekend refunded - but can understand being charged for the first night.

,AirBnB,"I'm new here, need a little encouraging.

I've been a host for 16 months and have received about four dings on cleanliness.  The first three lost my housekeeper her job due to the retraining and kind warnings I gave her (I should have let her go the second time a guest dinged me, and I should have begun walkthroughs after every cleaning - but I live out of town and was hoping for a housekeeper that didn't need babysitting.  I liked the lady so it was hard to let her go, but her work only got worse not better by the third ding, fully ignoring my retraining and requests.  

Ok said that to say this - my ratings went up immediately after that - but it took months to get the 3 cleaning dings off the first page guests see on the review page.  Until this last guest:  she only communicated in a positive way during her stay, then after, asked me to look for a razor she left.  I am happy to do that (it was a gift/sentimental item).  So I left her a great review, because other than leaving the house a little messier than guests normally do (not a big deal to me), she seemed a good guest, so I gave her 5/5 on communication too.

Until I saw her review.  She dinged kitchen and bedroom for cleanliness and gave me a 4/5.  I'd take that like a big girl except her ""private feedback"" said it was because she found a damp towel in the clean folded towels in the master bath and some ""leftover candy"" in the laundry room sink.  The chocolate kisses we put out for guests is in a locked cabinet just above that sink.  We think when our cleaner reached into the bag for the handful she places in a dish on the kitchen island for arriving guests, that a couple of the kisses slipped out of her (gloved) hand into the sink and she didn't hear or see them (she's older but VERY efficient!)  I had done a walk-through and somehow missed the two chocolate kisses that had fallen into the sink.  Questioning my cleaner, turns out they were at the very front of the sink's basin, untouched by the complaining guest, my cleaner having found them when he did the flip cleaning.  Regarding the damp towel, our cleaner admitted not letting the last load of towels cool once out of the hot dryer before folding, saying they felt dry but were hot.  Lesson learned.

Since we use the Covid cleaning list which requires hosts to pay more for cleaning if they are paid by the hour (mine are), going the extra mile, I just felt bad that there was no real cleanliness issue.  There was no dirt to report anywhere.  There were no complaints from her during her stay.

She messaged me about her razor just after the next guest checked in, and when I said I'd look for it when he checks out (tomorrow) and be happy to ship it to her, I'd forgotten she lives in Guam.  Hoping the shipping expense will be reasonable...

I guess I'm just looking for someone to encourage me.  When you work as hard as we do for cleanliness, it's discouraging because yes it will ""work itself out"", over time, but it would only take a couple of these unreasonable dings to set my rating back again for months and be the first thing inquiring guests see.  Trying not to be too bummed.

,AirBnB,"So I know that this might make me sound like a little crybaby but I‘m just a bit frustrated. 
A bit of backstory: For the last 10 months Ive been in Korea working and traveling around and staying in very run down dormitories that sometimes really brought me to my limit. Now 2 weeks before I leave the country i decided to book me a nice studio apartment airbnb in Seoul. 

This evening I arrived and realized that the pictures displayed on airbnb must have been taken at least 5-10 years ago. There are water stains around the window all the way down to the floor in 3 corners of the room the imprint of a hot iron is left on the carpet in the middle of the room. In the bathroom there is mold forming in the entrance to the shower and the paint on the cupboards in the kitchen area is all scratched up. 

I know this is rather an inconvenience than a real problem but I really dont feel comfortable here and I booked it for 2 weeks paying a little bit more than 600€  feeling like i go cheated out of my money. I am just not sure how to go about this I will contact the host tomorrow and ask about these shortcomings. Is there any way to get out of here or to get a refund over airbnb or is this all dependent on the host?

,AirBnB,"Dear fellow hosts (and guests),

Before COVID, I was easily getting 90-90% 5 Star Reviews with occasional disgruntled or impossible to please guests, who are unavoidable in a hospitality business; as well as the occasional person who believes 4/5 genuinely means very, very good, just not perfect.

I have an AIRBNB in a highly desirable location.

I have an on-call cleaning team and guest service should they need anything.

I have a mostly perfect cleaning team that vacuums, washes, cleans, scrubs, before each and every guest pretty near immaculate.

Meanwhile, aside from automatic check-in, I send guests a total of three messages: one the week of their arrival with town information and passcodes; one the night after, to make sure everything is how they find it; and one upon checkout to thank them and remind them if they have any feedback, please feel free to share it with me, and I am happy to redress any concerns.

Needless to say, since COVID started, I have actually had been busier than ever, which I am grateful for, truly, since AIRBNB helps me take care of a disabled sibling. But the casual entitlement, blasé manners, lack of communication, one word responses, and worst of all: guests who tell me repeatedly everything is ""perfect,"" ""all good,"" ""wonderful"" and then turn out to leave 4/5 stars is maddening.

,AirBnB,"I recently booked an Airbnb to stay for my 14 day mandatory quarantine (flying into state that requires it) and specifically looked for places with a flexible cancellation policy (full refund up to 24 hrs before) because I knew there is a chance I might have to cancel.

I asked them to cancel for me since I don't get back the service fee if I cancel myself.

,AirBnB,"Hey! So i posted last week about a host expecting guests/tenants of the (9unit) building to drive an hour round trip and pay $20 minimum each trip to dispose of garbage. I'm still fighting with both her and Airbnb on this,  she messaged yesterday that there will be a ""one time special garbage pickup between 6:45 and 7 am by (another tenant) and the premises are under video surveillance so anything removed outside that time frame will be the tenants responsibility""  
Well, that's not going to happen.  There's 9 units here,  and it's a landlord's responsibility. 

My question today: What about a multiple unit dwelling that's entirely illegal? I mentioned something yesterday about the stove (which is a propane burner cooktop installed on a wooden cabinet) being a hazard because it was installed in a way that forces the user to reach across the cooktop to turn the knobs off. He replied with the fact that there could be a fire and no one could help. There's not once single smoke detector in the apartment OR any of the hallways.  Out of curiosity i started looking for a fire extinguisher,  which was wedged well under the sink and was last inspected in Aug 2017. I then realized that this entire building,  all 9 units,  can't even be registered as rentals (a yearly renewal is required in NYS, and the building would never have passed inspection without smoke alarms), which means that the building has never been inspected by any health or housing authorities. If the shoddy electric shorts out or dude in the bottom apartment passes out with his blunt lit,  this tinderbox will go up in no time,  and the 7 of us in the upper 2nd and 3rd floors will just burn to a crisp because without alarms,  there's no way to differentiate fire smoke from the incense,  sage,  or other things being smoked or when whatever person downstairs leaves dinner in the oven too long. 
Literally everything about this place,  beginning to end,  is egregiously illegal. 
I'm attempting to work with Airbnb regarding the issues here,  but is this the kind of situation where i should go over their head and contact the Department of Housing? I don't wanna be *that bitch*, but even after Im out,  that seems like a big danger to current and future tenants and I'm kinda feeling like I'd be an awful person *not* to. The host won't even acknowledge the issues here,  let alone attempt reasonable resolution, so that's out...

I mentioned something yesterday about the stove (which is a propane burner cooktop installed on a wooden cabinet) being a hazard because it was installed in a way that forces the user to reach across the cooktop to turn the knobs off. He replied with the fact that there could be a fire and no one could help. There&amp;#39;s not once single smoke detector in the apartment OR any of the hallways.  Out of curiosity i started looking for a fire extinguisher,  which was wedged well under the sink and was last inspected in Aug 2017. I then realized that this entire building,  all 9 units,  can&amp;#39;t even be registered as rentals (a yearly renewal is required in NYS, and the building would never have passed inspection without smoke alarms), which means that the building has never been inspected by any health or housing authorities. If the shoddy electric shorts out or dude in the bottom apartment passes out with his blunt lit,  this tinderbox will go up in no time,  and the 7 of us in the upper 2nd and 3rd floors will just burn to a crisp because without alarms,  there&amp;#39;s no way to differentiate fire smoke from the incense,  sage,  or other things being smoked or when whatever person downstairs leaves dinner in the oven too long. 
Literally everything about this place,  beginning to end,  is egregiously illegal. 
I&amp;#39;m attempting to work with Airbnb regarding the issues here,  but is this the kind of situation where i should go over their head and contact the Department of Housing? I don&amp;#39;t wanna be &lt;em&gt;that bitch&lt;/em&gt;, but even after Im out,  that seems like a big danger to current and future tenants and I&amp;#39;m kinda feeling like I&amp;#39;d be an awful person &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to. The host won&amp;#39;t even acknowledge the issues here,  let alone attempt reasonable resolution, so that&amp;#39;s out...
TIA again guys! Hope y&amp;#39;all staying dance and heathy out there ❤&lt;/p&gt;

,AirBnB," As there are many great articles/tutorials on how to book on Airbnb, so this is not that. Instead, this post is to point out the crucial things when it comes to booking.

First of all, let’s assume you already have details jotted down, things like city, dates, and number of guests.

Then we shall begin.

The major factorsReviews

* Read the negative reviews
* Give more credits to the reviews that are under 6 months

Host

* Does the host own the property or he/she is just a manager
* Does the host lives in the place

Location

* The purpose of the trip
* Essential places around the property

Amenities

* Home appliance
* Check what the host provides

Policy

* Cancellation/Refund policy
* Housing rules

Photos

* Also, get the location of the place
* Ask for exterior photos and if it is possible, get the photo of the surrounding

The minor details

9 out of 10 times, you wouldn’t find these details in the listing. So if any of the thing mentioned below is important to you, you may need to message the host.

* Floor number/the lock (For security reason)
* How lit is the room at night/noise/how many roommates/type of bed (for sleeping quality)

Some of the factors here may seem hair-splitting, but I assure you, when you are going to spend a month in the property, every little detail counts.

If you want the reason behind each factor, you are welcome to let me know.

,AirBnB,"Hi everyone,

I’ll avoid going into too many details here, but I am dealing with a kind of sketchy situation at the moment. I was supposed to be a guest in a 2-bedroom flat for one night in a quaint little lake town. The price was cheap, and I didn’t go in expecting anything fancy. The host was very responsive up until check-in time, which made me feel good.

However, when I got to the place, the house was in decrepit condition. Apparently the inside of the house matched the pictures on Airbnb, but the house was very clearly in bad condition on the outside. Windows were missing and there was that paper (not sure what it is called but it’s used during construction) covering them. Trying to not judge a book by its cover, I messaged the host twice to say I was there. I also knocked on the door a few times since I read that he lived there too. No response. I had a bad gut feeling about being scammed, so I left immediately and found a cheap motel to crash in. I figured it was better than sleeping in my car.

Over an hour later, he finally messaged me back. He said that he was there the whole time (a big lie). He also said that since I did not text or call him, that it was all my fault. I’m pretty sure communication is supposed to be primarily through the app! I messaged him back telling him that I had messaged him on the app and knocked on the door and did not hear from him. I then also sent a message saying that I was upset about having to find a motel last-minute and sarcastically thanked him for it. He then blocked me. Come to find out that he has a gofundme page because he is unemployed and has no income. He also admitted that a car crashed into his house and severely damaged it about a year ago and did not fix the house. I also found out that he lied about his name and goes by two other different names.

I requested a refund on Airbnb (it would only be like $30, but still). He declined it just now and then claimed that I am harassing him. I only sent him two messages after his last response. Of course, I reported his listing as “unsafe”, so he is pretty upset. I just want to know...am I the jerk here? Assuming he wasn’t scamming me, I probably could have stayed in the house okay since I was on the second floor but I’d be worried about my safety the whole time. The house looks like it should be condemned. I also have read online about some run-ins he has had with the police in that town and is generally not well-liked and causes trouble.

My friends and I (eight in total) booked a house recently. The house is listed for eight guests and has five beds. The beds are two singles, three doubles and a queen sized.

There is however an air mattress listed in with the bed options. It makes it look like there is six beds in total and room for nine.

Boy was I wrong. We only have a few requests regarding check out, which are load and run the dishwasher, strip all bedding and leave in a pile in the room, and throw all used towels in any of the bathroom tubs or shower. They didn't do any of it unfortunately. It appeared they had a ferocious battle with some pasta sauce in the kitchen as they whole range top was covered in it, it was smeared all over the island and other countertops, huge gobs caked on the floor, all over the white cabinets, and on every appliance handle.

,AirBnB,"Currently looking for a week-long accomdation for a vacation. 

We found a very fancy looking place that can house 16 people, and charges 300euroes/night

This already looks suspicious to me, the place does look very luxurious from the photos, 300/night is quite cheap for 16 people.

,AirBnB,"I arrived at a ""private room and bath"" Airbnb today. The host was just leaving (by car) when I arrived. We exchanged hellos and confirmation of the lockbox code. She said, ""oh and the dog is there."" Fine, I just stayed for a week with a great host who had a dog and a cat. Previous host took the dog with her whenever she left the house; otherwise, she was home. Pets felt secure and happy and were good co-hosts.

This dog, a Spaniel, has access to the enclosed outside patio and lawn. I greeted him with a pat, and he sat by my feet. Seems needy and sad, but quiet. I should add that most dogs and cats seem to gravitate toward me.

About an hour after the host left (with no indication of a return time or date), I ventured out to find dinner (remote, desolate area) and came back an hour later. There was still no sign of host. I put my food down on the counter, and walked down the hall to use the bathroom. Suddenly, I hit a wet patch and went DOWN. Hit my head on the wall and wrenched my wrist. WTH! I said. Looked--big yellow puddle of dog piss. I also have serious spinal issues, and have had physical therapy and massage therapy this week, which is now forget-about-it.

 Despite having stayed for only **8 of the 32 booked nights** due to a hostile host, AirBnb support has only refunded me **~58%** of an over **$1000 dollar booking cost**. Support claims they are unable to issue any refund for the service fee or tax (over $230). The reason mentioned is because ""it is automatically computed by the system, and we don't have any capability to compute on our end"". This has been after nearly a month of deliberation, and calling, and I'm fairly frustrated.


### Some Background:

_______________________


You can read some in my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/hn1zwh/expectations_of_a_roomrenting_firsttime_guest/), but a week into my stay I felt uncomfortable with the host monitoring me through the cameras, telling me what to do, and threatening to charge me for ever opening my window, so I decided to move out. I had so far only stayed 8 nights, despite booking over a month. AirBnb had previously assured me that I would get a refund. Their only instructions were to talk to the host and then change the reservation dates on the App, both of which I did. However, after doing so, I received no money back, and instead was charged an additional amount.

I started calling AirBnB, who I have continued to work with for nearly 4 weeks so far. and only at the beginning of the 3rd week was there any movement whatsoever on my case. This was with me calling them almost every other day to get a status update. Supposedly, there is a technical problem that is causing me to not receive my money, and only through directly working with the host, were they able to get me some of my money back. I do feel I'm getting shorted on the accommodation refund too, as my refund is $40 less than what I calculated it to be.

,AirBnB,"AC is listed as an amenity. He says we can leave it on when here, but not when we leave (this was disclosed only after check-in). I asked to compromise and asked if we can just leave it off all day and then turn it on around 4PM as that's how long it takes to be cool before bedtime (10pm). But he said no.

I can't help but do some back-of-the-envelope math and realize how absurd this is.

I looked up cost of electricity in this region and for a family of four, it's estimated at about $200/month (yes that's expensive but keep reading). We're here for one more week (1/4 of a month), in a studio cottage (smaller than family of four dwelling), only talking about AC here (not all electricity) and only spend about 6 hours a day out of the house as we both work (1/4 of each day), I get

$300 a month for four people vs (one week)\*(2 people)\*(only 1/4 of every day) = 1/16th of $300 = $18.75.  And that's assuming 100% of electricity usage is AC.

I find it hard to believe that $18.75 is going to break his bank. That represents about 1% of the reservation fee.

You might ask why go through all this trouble just for AC. It's because I have a hard time sleeping when it's hot, as I'm from a colder climate. I even offered to have it off all day and just on at night, resulting in roughly the same AC usage, and he said no.

But I feel like if I tell him I did the math and offer him $18.75 (even double that just to be generous), that amount feels so low that it's insulting, even though I'm pretty sure it's accurate. Please if someone knows something I'm missing then let me know.

I knew this was the case before booking though they had mentioned the sound would only really be in the morning and early evening. I made it very clear to my hosts that my fiancee and I are moving from California to Colorado and that we would really need our sleep in their place to recover. However, last night we checked in late after driving more than 10 hours to Utah and showered and went to bed. Or tried to at least. The first noise was the garage door opening right next to us at 10pm. Okay I can deal with that. We have a bit of trouble sleeping and then are finally asleep when the family returns from wherever they were. They are stomping around now at midnight, completely unconcerned for the guests they have downstairs. And until nearly one in the morning we are kept up by sounds of showers and stomping feet and flushing toilets and otherwise running water which pipes go through the walls of our room. The worst part was the stomping. It is obvious they aren't even trying to be quiet. 

So I have not yet complained to my host about the noise in the studio but I really am upset. This morning they all got up at 8am and the stomping resumed and even woke us up despite host provided ear plugs. They are talking loudly outside our door and opening and closing their front door right above us very loudly. 

So please someone help...am I just being an asshole here? Am I justified in being upset? I just feel like if you are going to host a space for AirBnB then you should be willing to alter your daily life a bit to try and accomodate them. I have stayed in so many AirBnBs in the past. Whole places, private rooms, shared rooms. None of them have ever had this issue despite similar living situations. And my past experiences are making me feel like at least a partial refund is appropriate to request.

Edit: I messaged the hosts and received a positive response to our request for quiet hours after 10 pm. I felt this was a reasonable request and they complied. However, I found out that it is not even the host and their family living above us, but other tenants. Who I am unsure even realize we are down here. We left for the day to adventure around the city and came back around 7pm to the family above us yelling, moving furniture, and otherwise stomping around with 0 regard for anyone else. Now I feel terrible for even complaining since my request for quiet hours was respected (at least we hope by 10pm they will be). But the level of noise is absurd.

,AirBnB,"Hello fellow Airbnb hosts!

My cousin and I own a few places we recently put up on Airbnb. We noticed we were getting quite a few of the same questions from guests: how to use the washing machine, help finding the lockbox, and where the kitchen lights are. We typically share the same set of instructions with them over WhatsApp, copy and pasting it between guest to guest...but well, I like to make things streamlined.. so I created a little website I now share with them. It's a sort of ""digital house guide"". On there are videos on how to use the appliances, where the lockbox is, wifi password, etc. We've personally found it convenient since there's been a lot less questions, and when I think through my past travels, I could see this being particularly useful in international tourist areas I visited (e.g. Japan, and Italy) where having the manual in multiple languages could be made available easily online.

I was thinking about putting some more time into this to make it reusable for others, e.g. some simple templates, hosting it, etc. I thought I'd pitch it to the community if there is interest. If there is, I'd be happy to work w/ a few people to make this into something guests will find very useful for their stay. (I have lots of additional ideas too, e.g. can share local hotspots on there, house rules, have guests share notes for future guests, etc.)

* I ***didn't*** violate any of the terms or standards.

* I am now stranded in a foreign country which is on locked down (due to COVID-19) with no place to go because only a handful of hotels are allowed to operate and they are all luxury - well above my means. I've already stayed in one of them for 6 days when the first host canceled my booking. 

___________________________________

The host canceled my booking after I was supposed to check in. This is after they had me secure numerous - costly - covid-19 related requirements - which weren't mentioned during the booking process. Mind you the cancelation had nothing to do with covid-19. 

Aside from the requirements, I had to fly in from another city, which is on lockdown, and under restricted travel policy - very hard to do, and expensive. 

The city where I booked is also under lockdown, with curfews, and limited, government sanctioned, hotels that are allowed to operate.

I mention these things to give you an idea of my particular situation.

I contacted AirBnB and after being passed from one case manager to another (mostly due to our times not aligning and thus me missing their call), I finally landed on a terrific, COMPETENT, case manager.

This case manager really took care of me by giving me coupons, making sure I had a place to stay and helping me book another place - true customer service! 
Also, maybe worth noting, ""happened"" to be in a different country than all the other agents that just never led to anywhere beyond ""oh I'm so sorry to hear that. I really would like to apologize that you had to go through that"". I find it funny how they all used the same exact phrase to convey their ""sympathy"". 

Anyway, she told me I could use the coupons to book another place until I get my refund (which I know would take a minimum of 14 days) and sent me a list of places...And that is what I did.

HOWEVER...

This new host is trying to have me check in at a different date, weeks away! I let them know that I wouldn't be able to do that. Then they apologized and asked me to cancel and that they would issue me a full refund.

I read somewhere, prior to booking, that I'd lose the coupon if I was the one who initiated the cancelation, so I refrained from doing so, and called AirBnB.

They said that they would have to escalate my case and give me a call back soon. I took that as meaning a new case manager would be assigned to me. To confirm, I ask if that would be the case... affirmative.

I requested from them to NOT do that. I asked if I still had an open ticket with last case manager. They looked it up and said yes, I did. 
I requested to keep it that way and to not do anything. They said OK. 

I knew it would be a few more hours before my case manager would be in office. I decided to just wait. 

About an hour later, I call back to ask a general question. I wanted to confirm if it indeed was true that if I initiated the cancelation I would lose the coupon. 
I think I read it on the AirBnB community, so I wanted to double check by asking AirBnB directly. I planned to just cancel by myself if it wasn't true or if the policy changed to where that was no longer the case. 

I was connected after a really long hold. I started with ""Hi! Quick question... I'd like to know if coupons are refunded if the cancelation was initiated by the guest due to host not being able to honor the reservation"". 

Then they started with the security verification questions, which I thought was unnecessary since I wasn't asking anything pertaining to my account, but I obliged anyway...

Name, last name, phone number, could you repeat that please, I'm sorry I didn't get the end, email...to which I had to do the NATO phonetics Alfa Bravo Charlie. All the while my minutes are running low. I mention, when asked to repeat yet again, that this wasn't necessary and that my query was general and not about any account. Just a yes or a no. They say oh I'm sorry but we have to verify and what not. Method of payment...And then I hear the tone on my phone to let me know that I have 1 minute left and that the call would be dropped because I'm out of minutes. I say forget it, I'll call later, thank you, and hang up. 

Then I receive the following email from Airbnb community support from the same agent I'd just spoken with...

*""We take security very seriously, so first and foremost we want to make sure that your account is secure. Due to this, we were unable to answer any questions without first verifying specific account information.*

*If you did not contact us by phone, please visit the following page and login to the Airbnb website (not the app):... ""*

I little later I try to log in to my account and I see... 

*""Your account has been deactivated...""* 

I call Airbnb and they see my booking but don't mention my deactivated account. So I thought maybe since they asked me security verification questions on this call, to which I completed, my account was probably reactivated. 

This agent tells me the same thing the first one did, that I'd need to be contacted by the case manager. I tell her that I already had one and if it was possible to have my case manager call me. She said that I could do that myself by replying to a pervious message from the case manager on the AirBnB platform. I get on the platform and I'm still deactivated. 

I tell the agent that I cannot log in because it says that my account is deactivated. She looks it up and says that she would refresh my account, and later says that she'd have to report the issue to the concerned department, and that she is not able to do anything else. 

I ask if she could see my previous agent. She says yes. I ask if she could send my case manager a message or email to call me back. She said that she could do that. There is a brief pause while she does it. She gets back to me and confirms that she did. I ask her to not close the ticket and that at this point all I want is to get in touch with my current case manager. She says that she wouldn't, not to worry and that she has already reported it and marked my case as urgent. 

I ask her what exactly she reported and she says ""your case."" As far as I can tell there are two cases; the account deactivation and the booking. I ask which one she reported and she says ""both"". I mention that (if possible) the only issue I want reported is the account deactivation. I say this fearing they would asign me a different case manager. So I reiterate that I do not want my case manager changed. Again, she says not to worry. I thank her and hang up. 

I call back about two hours later to follow up. The agent puts me on hold while she reviews my case. She gets back on and tells me to wait for a case manager to call me back. I feel my heart sink. I ask who the case manager is and she says that the concerned department would call me back. I tell her that I've already requested for my case manager to call me back...guess what she says? That ticket was closed and a new one was opened. Now I'm feeling sick. 

I tell her that I specifically asked not to close my ticket and to be contacted by my last case manager. She says that it wouldn't be possible since this is a new case. But *it was* possible according to the previous agent! She replies with some generic script and it feels like I'm talking to a computer. 

Fast forward 5 hours, I call again to follow up because I haven't heard anything. The agent says to check my email because I've been assigned a case manager. I say I haven't received any email and she says there isn't anything she could do, coldly. 

I check my junk folder and see....

*""After a full review of your account activity, we have decided to remove you from the Airbnb community. This means you can no longer access your account and cannot create a new one.*

*You were removed because we determined that reservation [reservation number of current booking] may be associated with fraudulent activity.*

I went through the terms and standards, throughly, and there isn't a single thing on there that I've violated. 

This was yesterday. 

I had nowhere to go so I slept at an outdoor restaurant that caters to police officers that petrol during curfew hours. The owner was extremely nice and didn't mind. 

I wake up and see nothing from AirBnB, so I call. 

They tell me nothing new. They say that they would mark the matter urgent and that the concerned department would call me. I explain ""I've been told the same thing by the last 2 or 3 agents. It's been over 12 hours. How long do I have to wait? "" They keep repeating that they've marked it urgent and to just wait. Having no other choice, I say OK, thank you, and hang up.

I called two more times after that and each time they tell me the same thing in the same way, which is cold... clinical...robotic almost. They say there is nothing they could do and to just wait. I asked how long I'll have to wait because it's been over 24 hours already. But I only get the same answer ""you'll have to wait for them to contact you. There is nothing else I can do from my end"". I ask to speak to the supervisor and they say they don't have an option to transfer calls. 

Furthermore, my case manager told me to check into a hotel and send them the receipt. What happens with that now?

At this point I'm just so upset at myself for trusting AirBnB this much, especially when I've had no experience using it. 

I'd always used Agoda and Booking.com. I had several bad bookings (from thousands, literally) but they never left me high and dry like this. They always came through. I stupidly assumed since AirBnB is also famous, they would be similar.

I don't think the full extent of the severity of my situation has sunk in yet. I keep thinking this is just a big misunderstanding and they would call anytime now, apologize and fix this. But my first booking they called me back the next day. This time they are acting cold and it's been over a day and nothing. 

Cerfew is approaching and I don't know where I'm going to sleep tonight. I can't go to that restaurant again. I've never been in such a situation in my life!

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used the coupons to make another reservation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The host of the other booking wants me to check in at a different date. Not possible for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I contacted AirBnB for resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

,AirBnB,"EDIT: Very much appreciate the comments below on who is at fault.  I completely acknowledge that it can (and maybe should ) be us.  I'm really looking for the collective expertise of this group to tell me WHAT I'm supposed to do according to AirBnBs rules.  Do I just pay him?  Negotiate with him?  Direct him to file something in the resolution center?  Contact AirBnB myself?  Thanks again.

&amp;#x200B;

Newbie here - thanks for welcoming me.

My family and I have a 12 week AirBnB summer rental and we're about halfway through. We were not asked for a security deposit either by the host or by AirBnB.

There was a water pressure and dirty water issue at the property two weeks ago. We notified the host (by text, not through AirBnB). The host sent a plumber and the water was off for two days due to the repairs. Things went back to normal.

This week, the host came by and handed us a plumbing bill for $700.  The rationale from the host is that both he and the plumber assert that the water issue was our fault for using too much water and depleting the water source.  We certainly could have depleted the water source (in a straw that broke the camel's back sort of way).  We are a big family, the host did warn us verbally about water usage when he showed us around on the first day (He said ""watch your kids and make sure they don't use too much water.""), and our son used the water source extensively that day to water the garden.  We told the host the truth to help him and the plumber diagnose the problem and fix it accurately.

However, the host also has a lot going on on this property.  In addition to us, there is a non-AirBnB rental with two other people drawing from the same water source.  There is also some agricultural activity that may also be drawing from the same source (we don't know).  To me, this feels like it's  on the line between ""damage"" (which we would be responsible for) and general upkeep of the water on the property (which is the hosts's responsibility).

It seems to me like this is the kind of thing where AirBnB can help us resolve this issue.  I imagine that they have policies and procedures for things like this.  Is that right?  Should I direct the host to the Resolution Center?  Is there anything else I need to do?

I completely acknowledge that it can (and maybe should ) be us.  I&amp;#39;m really looking for the collective expertise of this group to tell me WHAT I&amp;#39;m supposed to do according to AirBnBs rules.  Do I just pay him?  Negotiate with him?  Direct him to file something in the resolution center?  Contact AirBnB myself?  Thanks again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newbie here - thanks for welcoming me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family and I have a 12 week AirBnB summer rental and we&amp;#39;re about halfway through. We were not asked for a security deposit either by the host or by AirBnB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a water pressure and dirty water issue at the property two weeks ago. We notified the host (by text, not through AirBnB). The host sent a plumber and the water was off for two days due to the repairs. Things went back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, the host came by and handed us a plumbing bill for $700.  The rationale from the host is that both he and the plumber assert that the water issue was our fault for using too much water and depleting the water source.  We certainly could have depleted the water source (in a straw that broke the camel&amp;#39;s back sort of way).  We are a big family, the host did warn us verbally about water usage when he showed us around on the first day (He said &amp;quot;watch your kids and make sure they don&amp;#39;t use too much water.&amp;quot;), and our son used the water source extensively that day to water the garden.  We told the host the truth to help him and the plumber diagnose the problem and fix it accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the host also has a lot going on on this property.  In addition to us, there is a non-AirBnB rental with two other people drawing from the same water source.  There is also some agricultural activity that may also be drawing from the same source (we don&amp;#39;t know).  To me, this feels like it&amp;#39;s  on the line between &amp;quot;damage&amp;quot; (which we would be responsible for) and general upkeep of the water on the property (which is the hosts&amp;#39;s responsibility).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me like this is the kind of thing where AirBnB can help us resolve this issue.  I imagine that they have policies and procedures for things like this.  Is that right?  Should I direct the host to the Resolution Center?  Is there anything else I need to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

Please review the following email I sent to AirBnB regarding my experience, which was never responded to.




“Hello,

I am so disappointed with my most recent AirBnb rental. Two days before my arrival date, the host sent me a message inquiring as to whether my ESA had found boarding accommodations. Prior to booking the space, I messaged the host to inquire about whether an exception would be made for myself and my ESA for my disability.

Despite her lack of regard/neglecting to answer my initial message to begin with more than a month before the reservation, the host became rude, argumentative, and discriminatory, making me feel unwelcome. I contacted AirBnb several times, by message and phone, requested a supervisor, and never received any form of communication back. Reluctantly, I went forward with my reservation, feeling unappreciated by AirBnb and scared to work with my host.

The host messaged and texted me saying she would provide an access code to the lockbox to retrieve the keys for the home, which was to be available by 2pm July 3rd. By 2:15pm we had not heard from the host. She was not answering phone calls, voicemails, texts, or AirBnb messages despite both myself and my guests being in the area and needing to access the home.

Finally she answered, rudely, stating that she's been waiting at the AirBnb since 2pm to give me the keys. This was never communicated, and frankly upset me due to COVID-19 and social distancing standards. I wanted a contactless check in and was not pleased that this is not what I received.

After looking me up and down after exiting my vehicle, the first words the host said were, ""Oh, your dog is nice."" As if she wanted to greet me personally to inspect both myself and my animal, and see who I had brought with me to the home (she texted the night before reminding me it was not a party house.) She gave a quick tour and promptly left, and my weekend from hell began.

My friends and I went out locally to enjoy the weather before returning to the AirBnb for the night to make dinner and relax. We began playing a card game, when my friend Katelyn, who is 6 months pregnant, pulled out a chair from the kitchen table and sat down. Immediately upon sitting, the leg bent inward, causing the chair to collapse and my friend to fall on the ground.

Luckily, Katelyn and her baby are okay, but that was a terrifying moment, and one that might not have been okay otherwise. After moving on from that, we decided to try to cook slices of pineapple in the oven, which is brand new and still covered in the stickers from the retailer. While the buttons on the oven work - lights, timer, etc, the oven would not warm to bake or broil. This was frustrating, but blamed it on a simple installation error and opted to spend $150 on pizza, despite having spent money on food to make in the AirBnb.

The next morning we got up - excited to celebrate the 4th of July down the shore. We went outside to open the umbrellas and ready the yard for a bbq, and found that the lawn was completely overgrown and filled with weeds. Frustrated, I began to cut the lawn by hand with a pair of scissors. I kid you not. I couldn't believe we spent so much money for a home that was not maintained and not functioning.

Upon turning on the grill to clean it, we realized the propane tank was left empty. My boyfriend decided to WALK in the 90 degree heat to refill this for $20. Once back, he and a friend put the new filled tank on the grill, which wouldn't light. Frustrated, they went to purchase a new girl for $150 so that we could cook and enjoy the food we purchased and brought to the home. This grill was in pieces, and took hours to build.

I cannot describe or explain the frustration, waste of time and money, and frankly disappointment and sadness my friends and I experienced as a result of this AirBnb. We cannot believe we wasted and spent so much to rent this space, on top of provisioning it, just to have to spend more to make it function as advertised.

Additionally, aside from having a forced contact check in, there was no hand soap anywhere in the home - bar or otherwise. There was a clear lack of regard for cleanliness and the COVID-19 situation and my guests and I felt unsafe (don't worry, I purchased and left bottles of hand soap for each of the bathrooms. [In total, over $500 was spent to provision and utilize the space as needed.])

I am letting you, AirBnb, know about everything I experienced because I do not want anyone else visiting this property and having the same experience, with the host or otherwise. Also, I would hope that a company who prides themselves on taking care of their disabled users and their service animals considers action, as I feel completely disrespected and cannot express my disappointment in watching both the host and your company violate the Americans with Disabilities Act.

I do hope and want to hear from a supervisor regarding how this will be remedied, not only for myself, but for future guests too.

Thank you for your attention,
Alyssa O”



Since this email was sent, I have not been contacted by AirBnB. However a representative from AllState contacted me for my contact information, as well as the information for all of my guests, to file a claim for injury. At no point did I indicate that my pregnant friend was injured or that we wanted to be compensated for such. I requested that the AllState agent request immediate response from AirBnB, which I still have not received.

Reluctantly, I went forward with my reservation, feeling unappreciated by AirBnb and scared to work with my host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The host messaged and texted me saying she would provide an access code to the lockbox to retrieve the keys for the home, which was to be available by 2pm July 3rd. By 2:15pm we had not heard from the host. She was not answering phone calls, voicemails, texts, or AirBnb messages despite both myself and my guests being in the area and needing to access the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally she answered, rudely, stating that she&amp;#39;s been waiting at the AirBnb since 2pm to give me the keys. This was never communicated, and frankly upset me due to COVID-19 and social distancing standards. I wanted a contactless check in and was not pleased that this is not what I received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After looking me up and down after exiting my vehicle, the first words the host said were, &amp;quot;Oh, your dog is nice.&amp;quot; As if she wanted to greet me personally to inspect both myself and my animal, and see who I had brought with me to the home (she texted the night before reminding me it was not a party house.) She gave a quick tour and promptly left, and my weekend from hell began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends and I went out locally to enjoy the weather before returning to the AirBnb for the night to make dinner and relax. We began playing a card game, when my friend Katelyn, who is 6 months pregnant, pulled out a chair from the kitchen table and sat down. Immediately upon sitting, the leg bent inward, causing the chair to collapse and my friend to fall on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, Katelyn and her baby are okay, but that was a terrifying moment, and one that might not have been okay otherwise. After moving on from that, we decided to try to cook slices of pineapple in the oven, which is brand new and still covered in the stickers from the retailer. While the buttons on the oven work - lights, timer, etc, the oven would not warm to bake or broil. This was frustrating, but blamed it on a simple installation error and opted to spend $150 on pizza, despite having spent money on food to make in the AirBnb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning we got up - excited to celebrate the 4th of July down the shore. We went outside to open the umbrellas and ready the yard for a bbq, and found that the lawn was completely overgrown and filled with weeds. Frustrated, I began to cut the lawn by hand with a pair of scissors. I kid you not. I couldn&amp;#39;t believe we spent so much money for a home that was not maintained and not functioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon turning on the grill to clean it, we realized the propane tank was left empty. My boyfriend decided to WALK in the 90 degree heat to refill this for $20. Once back, he and a friend put the new filled tank on the grill, which wouldn&amp;#39;t light. Frustrated, they went to purchase a new girl for $150 so that we could cook and enjoy the food we purchased and brought to the home. This grill was in pieces, and took hours to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot describe or explain the frustration, waste of time and money, and frankly disappointment and sadness my friends and I experienced as a result of this AirBnb. We cannot believe we wasted and spent so much to rent this space, on top of provisioning it, just to have to spend more to make it function as advertised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, aside from having a forced contact check in, there was no hand soap anywhere in the home - bar or otherwise. There was a clear lack of regard for cleanliness and the COVID-19 situation and my guests and I felt unsafe (don&amp;#39;t worry, I purchased and left bottles of hand soap for each of the bathrooms. [In total, over $500 was spent to provision and utilize the space as needed.])&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am letting you, AirBnb, know about everything I experienced because I do not want anyone else visiting this property and having the same experience, with the host or otherwise. Also, I would hope that a company who prides themselves on taking care of their disabled users and their service animals considers action, as I feel completely disrespected and cannot express my disappointment in watching both the host and your company violate the Americans with Disabilities Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do hope and want to hear from a supervisor regarding how this will be remedied, not only for myself, but for future guests too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your attention,
Alyssa O”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this email was sent, I have not been contacted by AirBnB. However a representative from AllState contacted me for my contact information, as well as the information for all of my guests, to file a claim for injury. At no point did I indicate that my pregnant friend was injured or that we wanted to be compensated for such. I requested that the AllState agent request immediate response from AirBnB, which I still have not received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, almost a month later, I am SO frustrated and disappointed with their response and am not sure where or how to proceed. Any suggestions are appreciated. Thank you for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

Ofc I won't cancel because I'm afraid once I do it I won't get anything. So I reached out to support and booked another place.

As soon as I booked it and got it confirmed, I got a call from the new host and he basically explained to me that that is not a real apartment I'm gonna live in, and instead showed me another (shittier) one and said that if I'd like to get a full refund he's fine by it.

I booked a place that I'm now in my third week of staying at with a week left to go until I'm able to move into my actual apartment. 
This place is a disaster.  The furnishings pictured in the listing aren't here.  The ""table"" is a door on a crate with a sheet over it,  and the couch is an antique wood frame with springs and two pieces of that foam you put on beds as a ""cushion"".

There's no AC or anything,  so it's over 100 in here in the afternoon which is wreaking havoc on my system. 
Additionally,  i run a home business. There is absolutely NO cell service here,  and she's running 9 units on 2G internet,  so it's almost impossible to use.  I ended up having to go buy a new phone that was wifi calling capable so i at least had *something* because i have a business to run, even though it doesn't work great because of the shoddy internet.

,AirBnB,"tl;dr first time renting, place was cool but missing a lot of stuff promised and the owners didn’t ever respond til 3:30 am on our last day there. couldn’t cook dinner bc they didn’t respond, then they left us a really bad review filled with literal lies. I responded to them calling out the lies but i want to get this review taken down


It was my first time ever renting, this past weekend in a small beachy city. Me and my gf saw the listing for a tiny house with 4.7 stars and wanted to go for it, and we had a friend in the area, so we did. 
$100 a night for 3 nights wasn’t too bad for being after all the fees, until we got there and I realized a lot of the amenities they said would be provided were “out of order” or just unusable. 
The outdoor fire pit had an “out of order” sign, which sucked because I drove firewood 200 miles for nothing, and the grill wasn’t charcoal like I assumed. There was a full propane tank attached though, and we were only planning on cooking dinner there one night so I didnt think it would matter. (the place only had a microwave and mini fridge so we were relying on the grill) 
 The second night came and we went to light the grill, I turn on the propane, hear it coming out, try to spark the grill, and it doesn’t work. I hold a lighter to it, and it doesn’t work. The propane isn’t going into the grill at all, and its 9:30 at night on sunday everything in town is closed. They didn’t respond to our texts even though they had been very frequent before we got there and we ended up eating our backup snacks for dinner. It sucked. That brings me to my next observation, “Private” to me doesn’t mean attached to a house and another trailer rented out on airbnb. The place was nice, dont get me wrong, but it was by no means its own plot of land like it looked like in the pictures. 
Their “provided snacks and drinks” were 2 bags of animal crackers and cheese doodles. The bathtub was a “1912 antique” only it didn’t have a stopper and was a weird shape so we couldn’t find anything that would stop the water. We had to shower and it was very uncomfortable. The only text we got back from the owners was at 3:30 AM on tuesday, when they said they could come replace the propane tank. No apology or anything, I didn’t care to respond.

Still after this shitty treatment, the place was nice and my gf basically said “its a nice place thats close to the beach” as the public review even though she gave it low stars. Didn’t talk to me before leaving that as a comment, but whatever

A few days pass, and they leave a review on us. Its scathing. They’re saying we parked in the middle of their lawn and that they called us multiple times and told us to park on the street (we literally were parked on the street the entire time that accusation was a boldface lie, and they wouldn’t even respond to us about the grill so they weren’t talking to us about anything). 
They also said we permanently stained their antique tub pink by dying our hair in it? My gf has pink conditioner but it didn’t stain the tub, if it had any discoloration it could’ve been wiped off with a paper towel or something. Definitely didn’t dye our hair. 
They also said we left the gate open, didn’t ever happen to my knowledge but they said they called us and told us to close it and we ignored them which again was a lie. 

Airbnb hasn’t been much help, Idk if i should report them for racism even though my gf and i feel like that may have been a factor, they saw us when we first came and then never greeted us or responded to our messages until a few hours before checkout, then lied about us on our review to make us look bad.

&lt;p&gt;Airbnb hasn’t been much help, Idk if i should report them for racism even though my gf and i feel like that may have been a factor, they saw us when we first came and then never greeted us or responded to our messages until a few hours before checkout, then lied about us on our review to make us look bad. We’re a mixed race couple who were visiting a heavily conservative area but it seems harsh to drop that accusation but it seems like one of the only ways I could report them through airbnb&lt;/p&gt;

&gt; Does requesting an extra fee and NOT changing the number of guests properly charge the guest the necessary taxes tied to the guest's omission of the guest?

&gt; I understand your concern on this issue [ChimpWithACar]!
&gt; 
&gt; Airbnb always encourages their hosts to work around with guests at the moment they send request to the host before confirm it. It seems that you are worried about how to charge the guest the necessary taxes tied to the guest's omission of the guest. However, if you charge this for the necessary amount there won't be any omissions for any fees.
&gt; 
&gt; It can seem that your guest is wasting your time by sending you a reservation request with different number of guests. However, it is always important to check every reservation detail prior confirming on our end. We sometimes can confirm a reservation that it doesn't reflect the exact details and we notice this at the moment the guest arrives.
&gt; 
&gt; I know what you say as this is more usual than we can expect. So as hosts even though we can consider it as extra work, we can use this to understand what our costumers and what the guests want. Also, as hosts, we are most of the time granted with the resolution cases if we provide the correct information.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for your patience [ChimpWithACar] and for being an active host during these difficult times.

The apartment over looks a park and is on the first floor of a completely refurbished terrace house. It screams a ready made AirBnB investment. It has its own private entrance at the back via steps. I would be buying the property with the intention of living in it first and maybe in the future making it into a self contained AirBnB.

I will be a no chain cash bidder and I am trying to work out my max bid on the property based on the yields I expect the property to generate on AirBnB. I used airdna to work out the annual revenue on the property based on it accommodating 4 guests and it is working out at £16,600 a year, with an occupancy rate of 67%.

A few questions to help me hone down the final expected yield.

1. Should I lower the revenue slightly as 2 of my guests will not have a proper bed but would have to sleep on a sofa bed in the dinning/living area of the property or has airdna already factored this in as I put down 1 bedroom on the site?
2. What is the minimum percentage revenue expected from an AirBnB in the UK?
3. Are the majority of AirBnB's purchased using cash?
4. Would the majority of AirBnB investors already own a house so would have to include paying the 3% stamp duty rate?

I worked out the rental yield on the property and it is only 4.5% based on the rental income of similar one bedrooms in the area so I assume if I ran it as an AirBnB I would expect to double this to 9% as a bare minimum. 

The property is listed at £160k and if I set my ceiling bid to £185k I would like to know if I would be scaring off AirBnB investors. A ceiling bid of £185k gives a final buying price including solicitor and stamp duty fees of £192k. If I then add on furniture costs of £2k this gives a final ready to let AirBnB cost of £194k.

If I take the Annual Revenue of £16,600 and take away expenses of (£800 council tax,£500 cleaning fees,£200 wear and tear,£1000 utility bills) this gives a total profit before tax of £14,100 per year. Based on a cash purchase £194k investment cost this gives a 7.27% yield.

I obviously do not want to over pay on the property but I am willing to overpay what the property is worth as an investment AirBnB by 2% to make sure I secure the purchase on the property as it will be a home for myself first and maybe an AirBnB in the future.

With my calculations would a max bid of £185k be enough to scare of AirBnB investors considering by my calculations it works out at a 7.27% yield giving me 2% headroom against what I expect would be a minimum requirement of 9% yield as an AirBnB investment.

I would be buying the property with the intention of living in it first and maybe in the future making it into a self contained AirBnB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be a no chain cash bidder and I am trying to work out my max bid on the property based on the yields I expect the property to generate on AirBnB.

,AirBnB,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been hosting an entire two bedroom apartment for a few weeks and will no longer be doing so after hosting the absolute worst guest paired with no help from AirBnB support. 

&amp;#x200B;

The apartment is listed with a strict ""No Party"" rule and within the first night I received complaints of loud music, parties, and knocking on my neighbors doors asking for my address and drugs. (sounds like drug dealing to me..) 

&amp;#x200B;

This happened on a Wednesday so without a doubt, we were in for a long weekend. 

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning I contacted AirBnB (over 1 hour of hold time) and asked to have the guest removed immediately. The Customer Support Rep asked to call the guest and ended our call with ""He sounds like a nice guy, told me there will be no more music, and that he just had his mother over."" 

&amp;#x200B;

After once again telling the rep that I would like him removed, she sent the case to another department and told me that I would receive a call back.. which I did not. 

&amp;#x200B;

As the weekend went on I received more and more complaints of huge parties inside of my apartment with no help from AirBnB besides a phone call that seemed to trigger the guest to party harder. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, on checkout day, a rep responded to me and said that they were ""making them leave."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Upon my arrival home I found:

\-holes punched in 3 doors

\-blood EVERYWHERE 

\-broken glass EVERYWHERE 

\-white powder on the floor 

\-blood in the bed 

\-hanging plants lit on fire

\-refrigerator unplugged and moved (all food spoiled)

\-kitchen drawers ripped off 

\-butcher knife broken in half 

\-slices cut into wood floor 

\-missing silver/glassware

I finally launched my Airbnb a few days ago the complaints are now on the grounds of harassment and threats of violence.

I had people over that weren’t from Airbnb that stayed over to test my place out and unfortunately had sex outside in the hot tub which I was not aware of as I was not home I did apologize to my neighbors but their biggest concern was they were of the color.

I have had sex in my backyard in my hot tub plenty of occasions never one complaint with the boys now there are strangers coming in and out of my backyard with a private entrance it is become more of a nuisance to their quality of life.

I really am at a loss of words as last night my neighbor blew up at me and my guests also calling one of my friends that was staying over with me a slut. 

I am beyond aggravated as my home is prior to 1938 where there is there a certificate of occupancy also the structure was built to permit the structure that was allowed as far as my understanding is also mayor Deblasio did announce that tiny houses are allowed in backyards. 

I would love some type of feedback that I could receive in effort to try to fix the situation but over the last six years that I have lived at my residence I have received nothing by threats harassment physical assaults I have been talked down to as a child during this entire time.

there are high levels of racism in my neighborhood as for as of me I am Jewish and my guests last night did notice that the anti-Semitism that I receive surrounding my home is beyond ridiculous

,AirBnB,"My house is not a ""smart home."" The house is almost 100 years old, in a historic residential neighborhood, and I live in the house next door. The only ""smart"" device I have as of yet is a window air conditioning unit. The unit in the back of the house is an old one, and is not a ""smart"" device. 

  
A recent guest opened all of the windows (at least what I could see on one side of the house) and had both air conditioning units running. She left the house for the day this way. As soon as I saw her leave, I remotely turned off the one unit that I could. Obviously, I did not enter the house to turn the other one off. When she returned, I wasn't home. When I did return home I received a notification that the AC was erroring. I immediately looked out my window to see that the windows were still open. I shot her a message on the app telling her that I had an error message from the AC, and that I could see she had windows open, and asked her to please close the windows if she was going to use the AC. She did not respond.

 She did however turn the AC back on immediately when it turned itself off. Every time she did, I got an error message. I looked out my window and heard the unit turn off, then turn back on, turn off, and turn on. This happened about ten times. Finally several hours later she shut all of the windows and then responded to my message, saying that they had the windows open, but had turned off the AC when they left for the day. That's a lie. One unit was left on, and the other I turned off myself.

The next day when they checked out, the windows were closed on one side of the house, but all were open on the other side. The house was sweltering hot, even though it was only 75F and overcast.

,AirBnB,"\*edited for more clarity\*

Hello r/Airbnb,

I tried to do a quick search in the sub-reddit for my question but I wasn't quite sure how to even word it.

My condo building has recently banned short-term stays and so as of March 2020, I have been operating with long-term (30+ day) requests. So far I've had full occupancy with multiple guests staying for 1 month and I'm booked until the end of August. It works out great because I am located in a central business district and most of the guests are business people here for work.

Concern/Question: I have a guest that is requesting a stay from September 1 to mid-October (1.5 months) - and I am a little hesitant to accept it because it could cause a gap in October, if no one wants to book a 30+ day rental starting mid-October.

Any tips/recommendations from other month to month hosts? Even a nudge in the right direction and I can do my research.

Many thanks!",t2_1735r7,False,,0,False,Managing 30+ day bookings,[],r/AirBnB,False,6,,0,,False,t3_hun5ke,False,dark,1.0,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,,1595264136.0,,[],{},,True,,1595287390.0,text,6,,,text,self.AirBnB,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;*edited for more clarity*&lt;/p&gt;

,AirBnB,"We rented a 2 bedroom house for a month in a rural area since the beginning of July in Pennsylvania via AirBnB. The total rent cost came around 4.5k.

&amp;#x200B;

When we arrived we found out there's a really pungent chemical smell coming out from a small empty closet in a smaller bedroom. To the point where I didn't feel safe to put our baby to sleep in the room. We found out they put a hanging Naphthalene in the closet, which was the origin of the smell. But then after throwing it away, another type of smell filled the room, but less pungent. We didn't think much of it and just turned that second room into a baby room with a travel crib and a changing station. And our baby has spent around 2 weeks sleeping there.

&amp;#x200B;

My husband found out the origin of the smell last night. Apparently some part of the closet is filled with mold and mildew and the rain last night + the heat during the night made the smell coming from it much, much worse. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically we have exposed our to a fungus infused air for 2 weeks. I looked it up on the dangers of a baby being exposed to molds and it's horrendous. I feel so, so terrible.

The hosts have never told us about this issue but apparently have been aware of it since they were just trying to patch it up by putting a very strong chemical smelling naphthalene in it, which is also btw, very harmful if you inhale them.

&amp;#x200B;

What should we do in this case? I just want to get a refund for the rest of the stay and get out of here, but as a person who doesn't like conflicts, I feel like I want to sort it out with Airbnb directly. Is this an option?

She extended to 2 months. In that second month, I figured out how bad it was. I think she was looking for long term to begin with, but didn't want to tell me that.

I know now to explicitly state in my house rules that pee pads are not an option for your dogs' care.

She lost the keys to my home. Three weeks ago and never told me.

I had to ask her to clean her space because of the stink.

The sheets are stained with red ink.

It’s two guys, a “working vacation and hiking trip” according to his message, they’re prepared to quarantine (the state is asking for 14 days if coming from a highly impacted area), and say they haven’t been in a grocery store for months. He seems normal and has good reviews (though only 3...) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I accepted it because we haven’t had a booking since March and I need to pay some bills.  I haven’t ever had such a long booking before so I’m a little nervous. I’ve never had any issues with shorter term guests, I have all 5 star reviews, and have been hosting for four years. Is there anything I should look out for with this longer booking?&lt;/p&gt;

,AirBnB,"Hi,

So I booked an AirBnB basement suite for 42 days for school related activities. This is the first time I'm using the AirBnB service. 

I just checked into the unit today, but I found some worrisome signs:

1) The listing clearly states that the Iron is provided as one of the basic amenities, but it is not available. Upon contacting the owner, the reply is that it is not provided because of safety concerns, but that I could borrow theirs. 

2) The listing states the the nearest train station is 5 minutes by walk. But it is actually at least 15 minutes' walk (google map shows this, so does my actual experience). Granted, I should have checked this out immediately after the precise address was provided to me. 

3) Basement unit is very very cold. I am shivering in the living room right now. The listing states that heating is provided. It turns out to be a small blower-heater in the bedroom, but which is not working very well (at least, it can't heat up the entire suite). 

4) The bedding has unknown stains

While I can perhaps put up with 1, 2, and 4, I find 3 difficult to deal with. 

My question is a simple one. Given that 1 and 2 are clearly misrepresentations, can I use them as reasons to cancel the booking (even though I am already living here)? Would AirBnB support such requests? 

Thanks

&lt;p&gt;I was reading Hacker News a few days ago and someone said you can opt-out of marketing with AirBnB by sending an e-mail to &lt;a href=""mailto:opt-out@airbnb.com""&gt;opt-out@airbnb.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I specifically said &amp;quot;I am requesting that all the processing of all of my personal data be terminated for marketing purposes&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They asked for verification and I provided it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I received an e-mail saying &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;...
Processing your request will take some time, but as a first step, we have deactivated your account. To learn more about what account deactivation means, see our help center article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/240""&gt;https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/240&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any pending reservations you had are canceled. Please note that you will not be able to reactivate your account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless we inform you that we require more time, it will take up to one month from the date of your initial authenticated request for us to finish processing your deletion request.
&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am absolutely flabbergasted that in any of our correspondence I was not given an article that said what would happen or that they would confirm I actually wanted my account deactivated and deleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost can&amp;#39;t believe this is possible and have been on hold for 45 minutes with AirBnB on the phone, with nobody picking up. My phone # is no longer being recognized so I&amp;#39;m just sitting on hold hopelessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this really it? Did I really just lose everything over a huge misunderstanding?&lt;/p&gt;

I assumed it wasn't actually on airbnb, I thought it was just a guy with an extra room on the side of his house that needed some money and that we were doing each other a favor. When I got there, there were dead batteries scattered on the patio, the toilet was running constantly, and the doorknob fell off from the inside. I told him I needed a place to stay for a month, but I didn't specify it was going to be his place the entire time, and we agreed on week to week. On the first day, I asked if he could put a table outside so I could put my ergonomic desk in as I have a bad back. He did but then left the door wide open with literally all my possessions inside and when I pulled up to the door, I had no idea how many hours it had been open. He does not live in a safe neighborhood at all. This freaked me out a bit. There was no kitchen, no sink, no microwave and no coffee pot, so it was a really uncomfortable stay, especially for any extended period of time. At the end of my week, I found (same day) a larger private 1BR in a much safer area with a full kitchen and TV for basically the same price, so I texted him later that evening that I was leaving a half day early, cleaned and vacuumed after myself and said I wouldn't need another week.

This man came down the steps, and stepped out behind the curtain and gawked at me, frozen. I covered my breast and screamed “HEY!” at the top of my lungs but he still stood there. Now I was frozen, because why was he still standing there like that staring at me? Maybe it was 10 seconds. It felt like minutes. It wasn’t until my boyfriend woke up alarmed, asking quite loudly “what’s going on” and the man bolted / tried to sneak rather quickly back up the steps. We found our clothes, and by the time we got upstairs this man was gone, and I’m assuming he was with a woman because they had been conversing in Spanish. When we got upstairs it was two african American women who had just walked in the door, and I asked them if they saw the man who just walked up the steps. They said they had just arrived and asked what was going on, and if something happened. I explained a man came down and stared at me, and didn’t leave until he heard my boyfriend. 


I notified the host immediately. And guess what he said? It was his FEMALE cleaning service employee. I said that is not true. This man was Hispanic, 200+ pounds, denim shorts on and a baggy grey t-shirt. I saw him clear as day and he most DEFINITELY saw my black ass naked. What disturbed me the most, is that he was quietly walking down the steps, and when he heard my voice he picked up the pace. And when he left it was only because a male voice with me was heard, my boyfriends.


I told my host this, again, with more details, agreeing there was another woman upstairs that knew this man, but no woman came downstairs into my unit and stared at me. This was a man old enough to be my father. I’m 20F, boyfriend 20M. We packed up and left immediately after my host said no male entered our unit. I told him his cameras must be fake because I saw this mans face and I watched his eyes look me over and the panic on his face when my boyfriend woke up. Now he’s saying how sorry he is and is investigating the situation. 


We cleaned the room as best as possible, removed all our trash and damaged nothing. The stay was great, up until my safety didn’t feel like it mattered and he said a female housekeeper was only in the house. Tomorrow morning at 11am was my check out time. I just wanted to share my story. I will never recommend this host again. His cameras clearly aren’t rolling and are just for show. I was numb the entire ride back home.

,AirBnB,"I checked into a new space today.  Superhost with hundreds of reviews, so you'd think he knows the rules, right?   It was self check in, rules say leave your shoes at the door, sounds reasonable.   But upon entering and climbing the stairs to my room, I discovered at least 2 undisclosed cameras. One of them in at the entrance , no problem, but video has been taken without my consent, the second one is worse.  It's in a common area I will visit often, pointed at the bathroom and kitchen areas.  It's a shared washroom upstairs and downstairs, so there's no way to avoid those cameras.   I messaged the host with this and other concerns,  there's something wrong with the room, but I think the hosts are off site.

The internet connection also keeps dropping, making me have to reconnect and log back in constantly.  I haven't reported that yet, I want to see what he does first about the cameras.

Host just messaged me he wanted to call, I was busy and ignored it his call, as I want everything in writing so airbnb support can have a record of it.   I know I can call them and get the reservation cancelled for the undisclosed cameras, but I need the room for the next few nights.  Some hosts continue to decline booking requests for Covid 19, so I was lucky to find a host willing to accept.   The host just messaged me again that he'll come visit tomorrow so there's no way to hide behind a screen, I have to face him..  What should I say when we meet?   I don't want to get aggressive or accuse him of spying on me, I just want him to realize his error and fix it, by removing the cams, offer a discount and apology would go a long way.

I definitely want to unplug the camera that's in the space I will access most often, but I don't want to be accused of tampering with his property.  Can I?  As I wrote above I didn't consent to being filmed indoors.   I also noticed a Nest thermostat, no problem but what's a speaker on the ceiling with a Nest logo?   I did a network scan and the Nest device was found.

**EDIT**:  I messaged the host with my concerns.   One room issue, a rattling air conditioner that was driving me nuts last night ended up being something minor and is resolved.

The host visited the next morning.  He knocked on my door and when he greeted me, at first he blamed me, saying I like to focus on the small details (I don't know if he read the reviews I left past hosts, but that was sometimes true).   I maintained my position that I felt uncomfortable that each time I entered the kitchen area going to the bathroom with the camera there, and by the way, I noticed it wasn't disclosed in the listing's house rules.  He deflected blame saying that his partner takes care of the listing, well I checked and that partner (co host) has had an account for longer than he has, but I can't prove that they neglected to disclose the cameras on purpose or not.

He also said that he rejected a booking request with a child this weekend because of me, he already saw me writing a bad review for noise.  Noise is my #1 concern, but I told him I knew what I was getting into by renting 1 of 5 rooms with shared spaces, I was just there to work and for tourism in my free time.  At first he agreed to remove the camera in the kitchen area and I agreed to let him keep the one by the front door, at least that way if someone tries to sneak in extra guests, he'll know about it and I'm OK with that.

I figure he's going to give me a bad review for being too picky/a big complainer, but at least I don't have to move out.  I will give his partner time to update the listing and if things go bad here, just request a stay reduction...I'm sure he wants me gone asap anyway.   I decided not to contact airbnb support for now.

**EDIT 2**:  Host was still here and must've spoken to his partner...either way, he returned and went back on his promise to remove the kitchen/bathroom entrance area camera.  He asked if I would be OK if he reinstalled it in the original position, as there would be a number of other guests this weekend, so he wants to keep an eye on things.   I said no, I'm not comfortable, so he moved it to another location in the kitchen pointing at the stove.   Now it's just partially filming the path to the bathroom.    Again, if I didn't need the space and had somewhere else to live, I would've asked him to cancel my stay / contacted airbnb.  Let's see how things go in the days ahead..

**EDIT 3:**  I discovered a third undisclosed camera: infrared outside on the front porch.   Understandable for security reasons given the multiple guests.  I just so happened to see an animal on the porch last night, went over to say hello and spotted the camera.

,AirBnB,"For context I am posting from Australia and this pertains to a property my father in law owns.

Background: My father in law owns a property that is currently being leased by one person. This tenant has not paid a cent in rent for over 6 months now and has run up massive electricity bills which my father in law had included in the price of rent. They have been to the NCAT (Australian tribunal related to disputes between tenants/landlords) and tried to evict him multiple times over the last few months due to not paying rent however it's a long and drawn out process and despite the fact they recently ruled in favour of my father in law, the tenant keeps appealing and getting the date extended indefinitely. We understand this system takes time but the only issue is the tenant's girlfriend has now taken to hosting the property on airbnb for the last couple months without my father in laws permission.

The tenants girlfriend is not on the lease and regardless there was no permission given to sublet the property in the tenancy agreement in the first place. Listing the place on Airbnb would be illegally subletting. We know the process for eviction is going to take time (especially with COVID going on) but we want to put a stop to the Airbnb listing ASAP.

We have tried literally EVERYTHING possible to contact Airbnb to get them to take the listing down. We initially contacted them about it 2 months ago when this started and provided all the proof and evidence they'd need and were told it would be escalated to URGENT status however have heard nothing since. Every attempt to contact them gets a template response and no action.

I finally had enough and got in contact with them via phone and was told by a customer service rep that the situation was serious and I'd be contacted within 5 days. Those 5 days have come and gone with nothing. I called up again and demanded to speak to someone from this ""urgent"" team and was told they only communicate via text/messages. I demanded to speak to whoever the customer service persons supervisor was to get action on this and was told I'd get a call back from him within an hour. As you could probably guess I never got that call. And now everytime I try to call from my number it remains silent for 20-30 minutes then they hang up with no answer. I'm not sure my number/account has been blacklisted in some way but I suspect so.

I am at my wits end with this. The tenants are letting literally anyone stay at the property (big groups of teenagers etc) with no vetting. Not only are these leeches not paying rent at all but they're profiting off the place. My father in law contacted his insurance and was told any damages won't be covered if they're caused by airbnb customers. And until the tribunal finally enforces the eviction (which could be months) we have no legal way to remove the tenant. I have no idea what to do anymore. Airbnb have been beyond useless. Could really use some help/advice if anyone has any.

Basically they are paying for the outdoor waterfront experience being convenient since there is no hassle of packing up camp supplies, setting up a camp ground, breaking down clean up etc...&lt;/p&gt;

- the suite was not cleaned in between guests (i.e. food in the microwave, dirty dishes). The host thankfully refunded us our cleaning fee. 
- listing had 4 beds, we arrived to only 2 - notified the host and they replied denying this gross oversight ( i.e. stating that listing originally had 2 beds). They even changed the listing immediately after contacting them, to reflect 2 beds instead of 4. We looked at our receipt, which obviously says 4, and contacted airbnb. 

Lastly, we headed out around ~7:00 PM today and noted that the second suite’s door (not ours) was ajar. We thought it was odd but proceeded to mind our own business and continue out of the airbnb. We then walked downstairs to find the communal area completely a reck: light fixtures broken and split in half, furniture out of place/flipped upside down, even some pieces of broken glass. 

We’ve been trying to get in touch with airbnb all day prior to the break in but can’t seem to reach a case manager. What do you guys advise we do? We don’t feel safe and have since called the cops. Do you think airbnb will refund our trip? Should we seek other accommodation?

They even changed the listing immediately after contacting them, to reflect 2 beds instead of 4. We looked at our receipt, which obviously says 4, and contacted airbnb. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we headed out around ~7:00 PM today and noted that the second suite’s door (not ours) was ajar. We thought it was odd but proceeded to mind our own business and continue out of the airbnb. We then walked downstairs to find the communal area completely a reck: light fixtures broken and split in half, furniture out of place/flipped upside down, even some pieces of broken glass. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been trying to get in touch with airbnb all day prior to the break in but can’t seem to reach a case manager. What do you guys advise we do? We don’t feel safe and have since called the cops. Do you think airbnb will refund our trip? Should we seek other accommodation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

,AirBnB,"Why do these mega corps treat customer's so poorly?

This company in 2018 made $93 million profit on $2.6 billion in revenue. 

Yet, when I show up for a reservation and find it filthy, and infested with insects, and I have to request refund, they try and keep their portion of the fee, $22.

Dark pattern: The app or website doesn't even allow requesting a refund of their fee, it only allows the host portion of the charge. 

Poor support: Then when I call support in the U.S, I have to wait an hour to get an overseas support agent. They should have support everywhere they offer services, not only where they can hire for pennies on the dollar.

Theft attempt: Then support, as trained I suppose, attempts to convince me that the fee shouldn't/wouldn't be refunded either. Even when pushed, it became an issue I had to prove further than the Host acknowledging, and apologizing for the problem in writing on their platform. Only after me pushing back further with a promise of a charge back, did they give in and refund me. The gentlemen providing the support was fine, respectable and a good guy. Of course I treated him with respect, and it was clear he agreed the policies he has to follow are absurd, just the circumstance he finds himself in with the job.

Lastly, now disgusted with such behavior, I can't delete my account for 90 days.

I'm sure there are valid reasons, and I agreed in the terms, but both being true they should acknowledge and accept the request, then follow through once the 90 days have expired. Instead, I have to come back in 90 days and request deletion again at that time.

,AirBnB,"This thread was inspired by [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/hpyi2o/cancellation_policy_changed_after_reservation/) by /u/FuckYourGilds, however it's something that I and others might have noticed already.

As I'm sure many in this sub already know, Airbnb's [flexible cancellation policy](https://www.airbnb.com/home/cancellation_policies) states that the service fee can only be refunded until 14 prior to check-in, or up to 48 hours after booking if the reservation is made less than 14 days before check-in.

Airbnb has recently added a ""cancellation flexibility"" filter in the search page, which makes finding places that offer flexible cancellations easier than ever. However, Airbnb omits stating the details of the service fee refund rules to guests in the listing pages. Just as an example, when looking at a [particular listing](https://www.airbnb.ca/rooms/27085337?&amp;guests=2&amp;adults=2&amp;check_in=2020-08-20&amp;check_out=2020-08-24) for the dates of 20-24 August, I'm immediately shown a section at the top of the page that states ""[**Free cancellation until 3:00 PM on Aug. 19**. After that, cancel before 3:00 PM on Aug. 20 and get a full refund, minus the first night and service fee.](https://i.imgur.com/s1Kk5Ky.png)"" If I scroll down to the cancellation policy section at the bottom of the page, I get [the same text](https://i.imgur.com/EaS2T7y.png). When selecting ""More Details"", [a windowed box expands](https://i.imgur.com/ZQx49JN.png) to show a graph indicating ""Full refund"" from when the reservation is confirmed to Aug. 19, 3:00 PM, 24 hours prior to check-in. The ""Get full details"" simply links to [a generic help page](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/2637/cancellation-policy-details) that offers no details of when exactly is the service fee refundable.

This is just as an example, but I've been able to replicate this with every flexible cancellation listing. Feel free to try yourself to see if you get the same results. As far as I can tell, Airbnb does not inform users looking at a listing about the restrictions for having the service fee refunded, nor do they even provide a link to their actual cancellation policies from the listing. Instead, they go out of their way to advertise ""free cancellation"" and ""full refund"" up to 24 hours prior to check-in, which is not true unless they have changed things without updating their cancellation policy page. If I were not a long-time user, I'd have no way of knowing that in this particular case the service fee would be non-refundable beyond August 6.

After the initial lock down, a ton of renovations and extra cleaning measurements I finally put my entire space airbnb listing back on the market.

After recently trying to book a stay, I was asked to upload my ID - a newly issued drivers license - which I did upload, and it said then said it was approved.

,AirBnB,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/hkwbhw/we_have_8_people_staying_in_a_4_person_max/)

The guest made contact a few days ago to pick up some things left behind, and said she would contact us to arrange pick up this weekend. So we held off on leaving a review or submitting the resolution claim for the extra guests and damage until this afternoon. We sent her a message yesterday to arrange to pick up her belongings by 4pm today and let her know that they would not be available for pick up after that time.  We got notification a couple days ago that the guest left a review. I checked her profile this morning and noted that she had a review from a subsequent host after us. I checked his profile and his only listing is a property in Niagara Falls with a capacity for 8. So this means when they left here they were headed to this other property that Airbnb lined up for them.

When my mom went to post her review and then create the resolution a couple hours ago, she found clicking the review link resulted in an error message and the booking isn't really shown anymore. She also could not create a resolution, the link to that is gone. She has been on the phone with Airbnb support for the past 2.5 hours on and off of hold being escalated from one person to the next. I think she's on person number 4 and they're escalating one level higher. So far what she's been able to find out is that the member has been banned from Airbnb. I can only think of two reasons this would have happened at this point.

A) She was a shitshow at that second Airbnb as well and that host escalated a complaint (his review of her was positive though, so that would mean he lied in his review. His rating is crap though so he may have just been scared of yet another bad retaliatory review, of which he already has 2 of his total of 8 reviews).

or B) She tried to charge-back (report the charge as fraud to her credit card issuer) one or both reservations.  I think this scenario is more likely.

We have now been told that someone will get back to us within 24-48 hours and we may still be able to recover a fee for the excess people in the apartment.

&amp;#x200B;

This has been a huge show of weakness in Airbnb's processes at the moment.  If this guest manages to have done all of this and then walk away and get her money back, Airbnb is now out hundreds of dollars in terms of our payout, potentially paying out our fees, losing all of their own fees from the guest, plus all of the expenses of the time taken of every single support person we have spoken to until now.  ALL OF THAT TIMES 2 for the other host they managed to drag into this shitshow.  These problem guests that they themselves attract and then leave the hosts to screen are costing them thousands of dollars per reservation.  They are going to need to work to fix this process if they want to stay in business.

The case manager who initially handled the bulk of this situation failed to recognize the moment when she should have shifted from improving the guest's experience and protecting Airbnb's reputation to the guest and instead start working to protect the interests of the company.  The moment that shift should have occurred was when the guest told her there were 3 people on the property and we provided video evidence that there were 8 people on the property.  Instead she continued to coddle the guest by moving them to another property that could indeed handle the number of people but she chose to deliberately take a shady guest and shift them onto another host to deal with.  After this case is considered closed we fully intend to get in touch with the other host and get his side of the story.

&amp;#x200B;

Will update when I know more.  Following this problem guest, we have updated our policies and I suggest other hosts that live on the same property as their Airbnb unit(s) consider this as well.  We have changed our process from self check in to physically-distanced check in.  This is now advertised in the listings and will be up front about it in messaging as well.  I have also removed the automatic e-mailing of lock codes to guests prior to their stay.  All guests will now have a distanced, outdoor introduction where the house rules will be covered thoroughly if they appear to be the type to not have read and understood them (you hosts all know the type I'm talking about, you can tell based on the conversation prior to arrival).  We will be pointing out things like the security cameras right there on the driveway.  All licence plates numbers will be written down at this time.  Government ID will be physically verified if the situation warrants.  Only after this physically-distanced check in process, will the guest be given the lock code.

If this guest manages to have done all of this and then walk away and get her money back, Airbnb is now out hundreds of dollars in terms of our payout, potentially paying out our fees, losing all of their own fees from the guest, plus all of the expenses of the time taken of every single support person we have spoken to until now.  ALL OF THAT TIMES 2 for the other host they managed to drag into this shitshow.  These problem guests that they themselves attract and then leave the hosts to screen are costing them thousands of dollars per reservation.  They are going to need to work to fix this process if they want to stay in business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case manager who initially handled the bulk of this situation failed to recognize the moment when she should have shifted from improving the guest&amp;#39;s experience and protecting Airbnb&amp;#39;s reputation to the guest and instead start working to protect the interests of the company.  The moment that shift should have occurred was when the guest told her there were 3 people on the property and we provided video evidence that there were 8 people on the property.  Instead she continued to coddle the guest by moving them to another property that could indeed handle the number of people but she chose to deliberately take a shady guest and shift them onto another host to deal with.  After this case is considered closed we fully intend to get in touch with the other host and get his side of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will update when I know more.  Following this problem guest, we have updated our policies and I suggest other hosts that live on the same property as their Airbnb unit(s) consider this as well.  We have changed our process from self check in to physically-distanced check in.  This is now advertised in the listings and will be up front about it in messaging as well.  I have also removed the automatic e-mailing of lock codes to guests prior to their stay.  All guests will now have a distanced, outdoor introduction where the house rules will be covered thoroughly if they appear to be the type to not have read and understood them (you hosts all know the type I&amp;#39;m talking about, you can tell based on the conversation prior to arrival).  We will be pointing out things like the security cameras right there on the driveway.  All licence plates numbers will be written down at this time.  Government ID will be physically verified if the situation warrants.  Only after this physically-distanced check in process, will the guest be given the lock code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These shitty people are why we can&amp;#39;t have nice things.&lt;/p&gt;

,AirBnB,"I have a reservation for August 2-3 that I need to cancel. When I initially reserved it, the quoted cancellation policy for the listing was ""Cancel before 3:00 PM on Jul 19 and get a full refund. After that, cancel before 3:00 PM on Jul 28 and get a full refund, minus the service fee."" I then received confirmation and receipt emails that quoted the cancellation policy exactly the same.

However, now that I try to cancel, the reservation cancellation policy has been changed to say just “Cancel before 3:00 PM on Jul 28 and get a full refund, minus the service fee.""

When I initially called customer support, the agent did not seem to understand my issue. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, she resisted. I offered to send her photos of the emails and original cancellation policy to clarify my issue, and so we switched the support channel to email. Her initial email said this:


“I understand that you wanted to get a full refund if you will be canceling the reservation.

To help operate the Airbnb platform, we charge a service fee to hosts and guests when a booking is confirmed.

The service fee is refundable up to 3 times per year if you cancel within 48 hours of booking the reservation.

The service fee isn’t refundable if, at the time you cancel your reservation:

* It’s been more than 48 hours since you booked the reservation
* You’ve already canceled 3 reservations within the last 12 months
* The reservation you're canceling overlaps with another reservation in your account

Please don't hesitate to let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.”


I felt like this completely missed the issue so my response tried to explain the problem again and provided screenshots to the original cancellation policy. Her response was this:


“I understand that you wanted your service fee to be refunded but based on the recent cancellation policy, what would only be able to cover the accommodation cost and I’m afraid we won’t be able to grant this request at this time.

For reservations where the host has agreed to fully refund a guest when a reservation is outside our extenuating circumstance policy, service fee isn’t included as part of the refund, butt we take away the full payout of the host since it’s a courtesy cancellation.

I know this is not the resolution that you expected and I wish I could do more but for future reservations, I would recommend you to contact us first before making any changes on the reservation, so we can provide better options and recommendations about your reservation. Before the reservation was cancelled we have options such as alteration where we can request for the host to move the dates further or since reservation dates are not yet covered we could have waited for future updates about the policy before canceling the reservation.

I hope I was able to answer your questions and concerns. Please feel free to reply to this message if you need further assistance or clarification. I can also give you a call if that will best work for you and I will be more than happy to help.”

I've used airbnb plenty and have generally been very happy with it.

Which means within the next 3 hours the ID needs to be verified, which it seems doesn't happen, and the host will need to spot it.

,AirBnB,"My partner and I have put an offer on a home that has a basement apartment with a separate entrance. The sellers have been successfully booking the apartment on AirBnB for three years (2017-2019). We saw their AirBnB income logs and most months they made enough to cover their mortgage.  My partner and I are hoping to make some income off of this apartment for the next couple of years until my mom (who is aging) plans to retire and move in. 

We’re trying to determine if it’s more worth it to rent the apartment on AirBnB or to rent it as a longer term rental/lease (like 1 year) with 1-2 occupants. 

With AirBnB we would need to pay for furnishing the space and that’s a big investment in the beginning which makes me nervous because of everything Covid related.  Sure we can get simple yet stylish and inexpensive items and furnishings but there’s no guarantee we will book the space as people are limiting their travel these days.  And the list keeps growing... coffee maker, towels, couch, bed, hangers, and more!  There’s also the constant cleaning and preparing that comes with AirBnB. Since we’re planning to do this for only a couple of years before my moms comes, I’m wondering if the time, energy, and money put into an AirBnB is worth it.  

With a single long term lease, we wouldn’t make as much money each month but we would be guaranteed to have an income every month once it’s rented. And we wouldn’t have to clean a second space every few days and pay a couple thousand upfront to furnish it. We could interview the person renting and run background and credit checks. Of course, this is no guarantee that we’ll get a dream renter but I find this risk kind of moot since it comes with both options but at least I can kind of maybe mitigate it with a long term renter. 

I know both options are work and come with risk but I’m wondering if it’s worth investing in setting it up as an AirBnB when that is going to be a short term thing (about two years).  Especially since we would be newbie hosts entering during a global pandemic.   Seems like the worst time to enter as new hosts honestly. 

What do you all think?  Given the pandemic, the relative short time frame we would be working with, and the fact that we’re new, which option do you think we should do?

So about a week ago I started desperately trying to get in touch with Airbnb about strangers that were knocking on my door thinking that they have rented my house (this happened last Wednesday).  Many phone calls, emails, and tweets later, they finally contacted me yesterday.  But.. 

The scammer took the ad down.  Probably because my wife and I had to keep reporting it, otherwise Airbnb wasn't doing anything and the ad remained - people could still rent my address.  So basically, ""Matt"" from this ""specialized team"" contacts me and says that the link I provided does not access a valid Airbnb ad, and therefore they can do nothing at all if I cannot provide an active link and that our communications were done. 

I pleaded with them to access their database, surely they could look up my address and see that ads were attached to that address recently?  Nope, they won't do that.  Of course they could just look up the fact that the ad USED to exist right?  Nope, they won't do that either.  I asked to speak to someone above this ""Matt,"" because this person just flat out refused to do any investigation into the case AT ALL.  Nothing, basically if I couldn't link an active ad for him, this was completely done.  This was his final response:

So where does that leave me?  I guess I just have to wait for the scammer to put the ad back up, and frantically try to get Airbnb to deal with it again before they take it down.  So that's that, I guess.  In the meantime, I will continue to tweet at them, because some small part of me believes that this annoys them.  I actually signed up for twitter just to do this, and my account is [https://twitter.com/Henry06949204](https://twitter.com/Henry06949204) if you'd like to participate.

I think I am a little in shock about my interaction with this ""Matt"" yesterday.  After spending days and days begging this company to respond and act, I finally got someone to reach out to me, and they told to basically get lost.  What a company.

Long story short: 3 friends and I were supposed to arrive at a cabin tonight. Half of our party arrived to a notice on the door saying the electricity was shut off and it’s unsafe to stay there because the meter overheated, which leads me to believe 1) no one has been there the last few days and 2) it wasn’t cleaned. Great.

After 3 hours of back and forth, our host got an electrician out there then offered to give us a discount. That doesn’t matter though, cause the local electric company would have to turn it on anyway and earliest they could come was tomorrow morning, so we’d stay there without electricity or water. Is this even legal? We declined obviously, cause f that, but now when I request a refund via the Airbnb app, it says we won’t receive our total amount back? What gives?

Do I wait the 1.5 hours to talk to someone from Airbnb to get a whole refund? This whole experience has been my worst with Airbnb. How can someone expect someone else to stay at a cabin without electricity, regardless of whether it’s free or not?

&lt;p&gt;Long story short: 3 friends and I were supposed to arrive at a cabin tonight. Half of our party arrived to a notice on the door saying the electricity was shut off and it’s unsafe to stay there because the meter overheated, which leads me to believe 1) no one has been there the last few days and 2) it wasn’t cleaned. Great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 3 hours of back and forth, our host got an electrician out there then offered to give us a discount. That doesn’t matter though, cause the local electric company would have to turn it on anyway and earliest they could come was tomorrow morning, so we’d stay there without electricity or water. Is this even legal? We declined obviously, cause f that, but now when I request a refund via the Airbnb app, it says we won’t receive our total amount back? What gives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I wait the 1.5 hours to talk to someone from Airbnb to get a whole refund? This whole experience has been my worst with Airbnb. How can someone expect someone else to stay at a cabin without electricity, regardless of whether it’s free or not? &lt;/p&gt;

Today, I go out to water my plants about a half hour before check out, and there is no car in the driveway. I check the air conditioner on my phone app, and it's turned off. Seems to me that they have left already. Cool beans. I gather all of my stuff, and walk next door to the house. Now there is a car in the driveway. 

  
That's weird, but fine. I assume they went out for breakfast and came back to pack all their stuff in the car. But wait- I see children! There are no children on the reservation. So they snuck in a couple of kids into a listing that is not suitable for children. I'm willing to overlook it. I go sit in the grass on the other side of the bushes and play games on my phone while I wait for them to leave. At ten minutes past check out time, I send a ""gentle reminder"" that checkout has passed. He immediately sends me a message back saying, ""We left.""

  
Bullshit. I can see them through the bushes. So I assume they are completely out of the house and packing up, so I walk around the yard. As I am approaching, he is telling his wife. ""I just told her we left."" He then looks up and sees me. I say, ""And yet, here you are."" He stammers out an explanation that his wife made the reservation.  I gesture to two of the kids, and I say, ""Your reservation was for three adults, and there weren't any kids included."" Again, some weird excuse about how the wife was to blame. He then asks me ""How can I make this right."" He says he used his wife's account to make the  reservation (not true) but he paid with his card. He then offers me cash. I tell him, ""just leave."" 

He continues packing the car at the same pace. I am behind already, so I go inside and start cleaning. I hear water running in the bathroom, and a child screaming. I find an older woman bathing a child. I tell her, ""You have to leave now."" She screams, ""I HAVE A POOPY BOY HERE! I already told the owner that we left, so leave e alone!"" I said, ""I am the owner."" She apologizes, explaining that her daughter in law is quite rude, so that's why she yelled at me. I told her that they have to vacate immediately.  She complies. 

The family then sits in the car in the driveway for another five minutes. Long enough for me to find a flashlight under a pillow and give it back to them.

,AirBnB,"My fiancé  and I have FINALLY decided on a date for our wedding. Yay!!...Unfortunately, finding a suitable venue has proven quite a bit more difficult.

Since we want to have the wedding ceremony and reception in the evening, we thought renting an AirBnB that could host everyone would be a fun idea. The biggest issue so far has been AirBnB's lack of proper search functionality. For example, it's possible for a host to specifically list under the ""House Rules"" section that no events are allowed. But there's no way to filter out properties that don't allow events. Nor can I search for keywords that might mention whether or not there are any noise ordinances after a specific time, etc.

Basically, I've been having a hard time figuring out how to even find the AirBnBs that could potentially suit our needs. I'm not sure if you fine folk will be able to help me, but I figured there's no harm in asking!

If you have any specific AirBnB recommendations, or city/state recommendations, or even recommendations for how to search, I would GREATLY appreciate it!

Here's what we're looking for:

1. While there are others we would definitely consider, the states currently on our radar are: Utah, Arizona, Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. Basically, that entire half of the country. xDWe're not really considering Colorado, but only because we live here and wanted to go somewhere else for the wedding.
2. We would like a venue that can host about 50 guests for the actual wedding, and sleep as many as possible. I'm not yet sure how many people would even want to sleep at the rental location, but I want to be prudent.
3. The wedding will be in August of next year, and we would like to rent the venue for 1 week.
4. One of the most important considerations (and why we chose the west half of the country, aside from its natural beauty) is that we need a location that's DARK. I mean pretty far from any major cities, if not directly in or around a dark sky preserve. We want to be able to get a clear view of the stars, as we're intentionally getting married during a meteor shower.
5. The place we're renting should also be fairly isolated. Since the reception won't even begin until it starts getting dark, we definitely don't want to have to be quiet as soon as it hits 9PM.
6. We plan on getting married outside, so the location should have enough of a lawn/backyard to host everyone. A nice view would be huge bonus! This can be any type of natural splendor, from lakes to mountains to trees to unusual landscapes of any and all sorts.
7. Lastly, I've been trying to find venues that have activities available on-site. I've come across things as simple as the host providing board games and DVDs, and as elaborate as having a private lake with canoes for guest usage. Volleyball courts, tennis courts, air hockey, ping pong, etc. aren't too uncommon, either. We'll have a range of age groups and interests, so the more activities the better!

,AirBnB,"So we arrived to our Charleston,SC Airbnb yesterday and the place wasn’t as clean as we would like (especially for COVID reasons). There was food bits on the table chairs, hair in the bathtub, moldy shower curtain, and some grime on light switches and cabinets.

Later in the night we saw LARGE cockroaches on the porch and went inside to hangout. Then we found at least 5 of the same LARGE cockroaches crawling in the sink/fridge and in the bedrooms. 

Is this expected? Is there anything I can do? I want to continue to stay here, but I’m kind of pissed I paid over two grand for this place and not a single review said there were roaches.... 

The host said they are common and there is spray,  but I kind of want some money back because I obviously had problems with the cleaning and now there’s bugs. How often do hosts give back partial refunds or remedy this situation? And do some hosts actually pay you to take down poor comments?

,AirBnB,"--- RESOLVED ---

I'm in an AirBnB for a longer term stay, from mid-May until mid-August. It's currently July 9th and I'm living here.

The place is alright, exactly as advertised but about 2 weeks ago I found a mouse in the apt, I contacted the host and they said to go buy mousetraps and I'll be reimbursed. I did, and I was (about $12 total). Caught the mouse, now this morning I just caught another one in another trap.

I'm concerned about this and I don't feel safe living here after reading about the dangers of mice infestations. Like I'm sure I'll be personally fine but it's anxiety-causing and it is the landlord's responsibility to ensure that there are no pest infestations. 

There's no food left out or anything either, the place is clean. 

Do I have grounds to ask for a refund on part of rent? Rent is about $2200/mo which is high anyway for a small old studio albeit the location is awesome.

Should I ask for a month of rent back? A week? What's the procedure here? 

Thanks in advance.

Usually I wouldn't ask for help or advice like this but AirBnb's support seems to be the worst experience that I've ever had. After almost 4 days of waiting after my first ticket and 6 additional messages later, AirBnb support 'specialists' (how they're calling them) haven't even reacted in any way.

I feel like I'm trying to talk to a wall. No response, no notification, no nothing. And I'm stuck with this host that probably has my money now and Airbnb can't help with the refund because they're not answering their support tickets.

,AirBnB,"Hi all, 

So, a quick introduction about myself. I’ve been a digital nomad for all of my adult life. My current country count is around 80. My ultimate goal is to visit every country in the world.

One of the biggest problems I have in my journey is accommodation. 

I enjoy staying in a place for around a month or two, so usually, I tend to choose Airbnb or similar long-term rental. Usually, other popular options like couch surfing or hostels are not reliable or not suitable for the long term. 

So I come up with a system (more like a comparison) on how to choose the remaining option:

1. Long-term rental holiday house (Airbnb)
2. Hotel

**If the cost of your destination is low**

On the one hand, hotels are used by both locals and foreigners. 

On the other hand, Airbnbs are mostly used by foreigners. 

Due to this asymmetry of the customers’ demographics only hotels are compelled to set their prices in accordance with the rest of the prices paid by locals. 

If the city has a low cost of living then it is likely hotel prices will below also.

Keep in mind that this rule is not absolute. But it is generally true when we are comparing a hotel and an Airbnb of the same “quality” in cities with a cheap cost of living.

Southeast Asia is a good example. In this part of the world, which has a very low cost of living, it is very common to find hotels in the city center that are cheaper than Airbnbs in the same area.

**If the city you are visiting is small**

The smaller the city is, the less likely there will be a good (if any) option in terms of Airbnb.

Generally, there isn't enough demand for Airbnbs in small cities, since this type of accommodation is more targeted to foreigners.

Hotels are a more traditional form of accommodation. Therefore these can be found almost anywhere.

So, as a rule of thumb, if you are going to a small city it is better to look for a hotel.

**If you want to socialize on your trip**

With hostels, you will be staying in a place that provides a chill vibe where people are generally open to meet other travelers. 

With Couchsurfing, you can socialize with the host which most likely is a local himself and a person that is eager to meet travelers.

You might ask yourself “What is the difference between socializing with a Couchsurfing host and an Airbnb host?  Both are likely to be locals”. 

The answer has to do with the hosts' attitude.

Generally, there is a difference in terms of the attitude of Airbnb hosts and Couchsurfing hosts concerning the relation of themselves with their guests. 

Most Airbnb hosts see what they are doing as a business, thus they are less likely to be interested in socializing with the guests. But, of course, there are exceptions here.

On the other hand, Couchsurfing is a free and voluntary service. Consequently, Couchsurfing usually attracts hosts that are directly interested in meeting and talking with their guests.

**If you don’t have much time in the destination**

If you have little time in a place, it makes sense to stay in a hotel or hostel, rather than on an Airbnb.

Because, well, you can’t really treat Airbnb as a hotel room. After all, you are staying in someone else's property…

TL;DR: I make a comparison that in different scenarios or purpose that what accommodation you should choose for your next trip. Generally, I think Airbnb is the winner.

,AirBnB,"Hi everyone. I'm a first-time guest staying for a sizeable amount of time in a single room at an airbnb, so apologies for any of lack of knowledge. I'd just like to know the expectations of me as a room-renter, to just have better general knowledge and know how I can approach situations better.

Overall, I'm a pretty clean guest who uses the kitchen regularly. I'll clean my dishes immediately after using them, and try to stick to my own room if possible. 

The reason I'm bringing this question up is because I'm unsure of what could lead to me getting kicked out, charged fees, etc. Recently, the host has requested me to do several things that aren't listed in the house rules, and I want to comply with these as much as possible while maintaining healthy boundaries. 

A few examples of these requests.

- wiping down surfaces after each use (refrigerator, pantry, stove, etc.)
- ensuring certain doors are shut after use (like closets and pantries)
- shutting off lights
- leaving doors open (like the bathroom)
- not bringing water bottles to the bathroom
- not opening windows at all (I'm on the second floor)

The host lives in the house, and has 24/7 video camera surveillance, so some of these issues have brought to my attention in person, and others over messages. I was also told I would be charged a fee if I opened the window again, which I'm very disheartened about because I much prefer sleeping with my window open.

I did have a conversation with the host to express my level of discomfort with being monitored, which I think led to some progress. But because they are very particular about things, and I'm very private, i don't expect a complete 180. 

Is this typical host behavior? Am I within my rights as a guest to say no any of these requests?

,AirBnB,"I recently completed a 3 night stay at an awesome airbnb in Palm Springs.  The home was beautiful and we had a great time except for one tiny problem - every morning we would wake up with more and more bug bites.  

After the first night, my wife was the only one with these bug bites so we assumed they were mosquito bites as I saw a few flying around the backyard and I know the area is having a bad mosquito problem this year.   The following morning I woke up with a few small bites on my back and, as someone who is allergic to mosquito bites, was somewhat surprised as I did not have an allergic reaction to the bites and thought it was odd that they appeared overnight.  My wife also had a few more on her legs.  We ripped the sheets off the bed and inspected for bed bugs but did not find any of the tell tale signs that we found on google.  We convinced ourselves that it must be something else - fleas in the back yard or something like that - and decided to sleep in the same room for our last night.  

That last night was the worst.  Both my wife and I woke up after our 3rd and final night's stay with a ton of bug bites all over our bodies.  My wife has over 40 and I have over a dozen.  On top of this, there was now a small red/brown blood stain on the sheets (only one spot though).  We immediately notified the host who said she has never had this problem and would call an expert to look into the matter.  She just contacted me to tell me that the pest guy found no signs of any sort of infestation and suggested that we must have left the back sliding doors open and let mosquitoes into the house in the middle of the night.  That definitely did not happen as I have two little kids and the backyard had a pool - I absolutely would not leave the door open for them to run out and fall in.  I'm one of those paranoid lock checkers who will double and triple check all locks before going to bed.  The doors were not left open.

This was our first time using Airbnb.  At over 800$ a night including all of the fees, I expected more and feel ripped off.  I've reached out to both the host and Airbnb to see what can be done.  Airbnb hasn't gotten back to me and the host stands firm at its not coming from her house.  Any advice on what I can do next?  I feel like at least a partial reimbursement is in order.

All seemed fine except for some extremely long house rules from the host which we agreed to, but now the hosts are insisting we send photos of our full IDs to a personal email account prior to the stay.

,AirBnB,"Hello everyone,

recently I was searching for an apartment in Berlin. I found very suspicious offer on eBay. I received three e-mails from that host. The first one was about the apartment. He also told me a story, that he moved from Berlin to UK because he opened in UK a new business recently. The second one is the message I attached below. In the second mail he was talking some bullshit about him wanting to give this apartment to the right person and he presented airbnb to me as a safe solution for both of us. He also wants some of my personal information like Name, address, and copy of my ID. To get my trust he send me his passport. The whole situation looks very suspicious to me but I have no experience regarding airbnb safety so I don't know what I should do. In addition the apartment is beautiful, fully renovated, spacious and its price is way lower that the average (750 Euro/Month for 80m2 in the centre of Berlin). I attached two e-mails below because the first one was only about the apartment. What do you think about it and what should I do with him?

Hello xyz,  
Thanks for your interest in my apartment. I must tell you that I have some people who are interested in the apartment, but I want to rent it to the right person. For the moment I don't have a person available in Germany to show you the apartment, be sure that i can't send the keys to you only for some words...This will not be a problem, because I know a safe method to resolve this situation. We can make a long period contract or a short one, depends on your decision. As i said in my first email, the Anmeldung it is possible. I will repeat, in the monthly rent all the bills are included, you will pay only the rent, nothing else more. As I said in the first message, i ask for  750 euros (rent for 1 month) + a Kaution of 1500 euros  
Please tell me if you know about Airbnb Platform !  
www.airbnb.com/trust \--- probably you have used this company for your travels or reviews about destinations. If not you can make a research online on the link that i gave you.  
I want to use this company for key exchange and also for the payment, so we both feel safe this is how I have done it before.  
The apartment is already available, so you can visit and move in next days if you ready to proceed. I am going to explain the process in my next message if you are interested.  
Greetings from United Kingdom

Hi again,  
The whole process is simple and safe. I believe you serious, please take care of my apartment. Pets are accepted but you must try to keep the furniture as clean as normal because i paid a lot of money for the renovation. If you are ready to proceed with the transaction i need to inform you how this works:

1. I will send you the Airbnb invitation so you can select the period and follow the steps to finish the booking and payment to Airbnb website.
2. Airbnb will require the deposit confirmation of the first month payment and security deposit (first month of rent + 1500 euro Kaution (Kaution like i said, you will receive back at the end of the contract) = 2250 EUR). It will be done through their website.
3. After the payment is confirmed, the leasing process begins.
4. Airbnb will notice me, and after, i will buy a flight ticket to Germany, to come with the keys and the contracts of the apartment. You will have only two days to check the apartment and to take a decision if you will want to rent it or no.
5. If everything is in order and you decide to rent the apartment, Airbnb will give me the money after you will sign the contracts of rental. Additional rents will be sent directly to my personal bank account.
6. If you refuse to rent the apartment, Airbnb will give you a full refund!  
Now, if you are interested in renting the apartment I will need the next informations from your side:  
Name:  
Address:  
City:  
Postal code:  
Country:  
ID or passport copy attached via e-mail:

,AirBnB,"Hi I just wanted to let everyone know about a new website I have built for those hosts running a short term rental. It's called [www.strtools.com](http://www.strtools.com) . My goal has been to build tools that I myself would find useful in running my own AirBnb.

At the moment I have only been able to develop the checklist feature and collaboration feature. You are able to create checklists, add people to your property and they are then able to fill out those checklists for things such as cleaning / maintenance / safety checks etc.

I will be adding more features as time goes on and also adding direct integration with AirBnb/Booking.com etc.

For now this site will remain 100% free for the foreseeable future, especially as I know its pretty tough at the moment for str hosts during this covid situation.

It is also the perfect opportunity to integrate cleaning / covid checklists into your guest checkout cleaning to ensure everything is done correctly and nothing is missed.

My goal is to create the best hosting tools platform on the web that will help support STR hosts and help them manage their properties.

I have been on furlough from my work for the past 3 months (due to the covid situation) and probably will be on furlough for the next 3 months so this was a project I built to keep me sane during lockdown.

I am open to any suggestions, improvements or feature requests you may have.

Thanks and enjoy!

Simon

,AirBnB,"Hi, quick background, I booked a multi-week stay with a host in FL.  Because of covid, the host asked to cancel my stay 7 days prior to my trip.  (I initially booked the trip in June '20, so well into Covid) I didn't really have a choice in the matter, I get an email from Airbnb that the reservation is cancelled, they refunded my payment, and sent me a $200 coupon to rebook another place of equal or greater value within 30 days (same area, same trip).  Now $200 is 5% of the reservation amount I already outlaid a month ago when they charged my card for the trip they just cancelled, it's nothing for a 3-week stay, $10 a day credit.

I am really mad about this, I feel that Airbnb as a marketplace is quick to basically wash their hands of this situation.  The $200 assumes 1) I can find another place in the area, on short notice, that is the right size and location 2) that place will be available for the extended stay I need, and 3) assumes the place allows pets (the original one did).  Well, there arent any, or at least none within a reasonable price range to what I booked.

So the reason I'm mad is that if I cancelled my stay, Airbnb was to charge me $500 or so in service fees as well as I'd lose half of the reservation rate (nonrefundable deposit).  But when I get cancelled, they just treat it like ""hey so sorry, go fuck off"".

The host has been fine to work with, it's a bad situation all around and I get that, but am I wrong to be mad at Airbnb and how they handled it?  If this was a hotel, Marriott might have offered to find another room, upgraded me to a suite if need be, or worst case found another hotel in the area and sorted out the difference in cost.  I feel like Airbnb should do more for me because MY cancellation penalty was 2-3x more punitive than whatever they offered.

Edit: Airbnb case manager is involved now.  They will shorten the reservation to end at 11 AM EST.  Of course, it has been almost an hour and they have not managed to make contact with the guest yet.  Not surprised at all on that one.  Last time we had to continuously set off the test mode on the Nest Protect system until they came out to ask what all the noise was.

Edit 2: that case manager finished their shift and handed of to a different one. This new one seems to be not as interested in helping us and more interested in getting the guest's side of the story. I'm now here at the property. Everyone in the unit downstairs seems to be asleep still.

Edit 3: going to request a different case manager if this situation does not improve in the next hour. It seems this second one is really shit at her job.

Final update: Case manager managed to get through to the guest. Asked guest how many people were there. Guest said 3. Case manager was reminded that we had already submitted video footage from the night showing 8 guests on the property and that there were now 5 of those people hanging out in front of the house. Booking guest agreed to cancel the booking, supposedly the case manager told them we were willing to refund them the rest of the stay.  That was floated as an idea around 7am thinking we could clean and re sell the Sunday night at least. Since they only got this cancellation agreement at 3pm, 8 hours later, we have affirmed that we never agreed to the refund being done 8 hours later, it was predicated on getting the guests out in the morning. We have agreed to let them refund the Sunday night only. We'll see what actually happens.

Guests discovered the cameras (hiding in plain sight) and they all left quickly without incident following that, but left the apartment a pig sty. Still to claim extra 4 guests through resolutions, plus a small broken sculpture, and possibly buffing stains out of a wooden table when coasters were sitting literally 2 inches away from where the glass was placed on the wood.  The way they fucked off so quickly suggests they were up to something they didn't want being watched.

I will admit the screening in this case was ineffective and we'll be changing some of those practices moving forward, especially since the average tourist right now is shittier than they have been in past years.

* automatic payments for host and cleaning people
* quarterly payment and filing of hotel taxes (5% to the county, not handled by Airbnb unfortunately)
* yearly 1099s
* business tax prep and filing, probably a traditional CPA
* keep condo association fees paid, hopefully they have online bill pay
* carry whatever insurance needs to be carried; I think the condo requires this

I have an inkling that they're not setting prices very efficiently, since they're allowing bookings more than a year out.  I've read Airbnb's smart pricing might not be in your best interest strategically.  So maybe would look into a solution that autoprices more aggressively.

,AirBnB,"Hi all, I just wrote a post about how to get a refund from Airbnb when the actual house is different from the photo.

I understand most people on this sub reddit are hosts, but this is more for the tenant. 

The reason why I decided to write about this topic is because this happened to me quite a few times and I thought my perspective could help some people out there. Besides, I am my only reader so I can’t really give it a fair criticism.

So, here we go:

Everything mention below is better to be done within 24 hours after check-in. It is possible to get a refund after a 24 hour window, but things get more complicated after that.

&amp;#x200B;

**Evaluate the property**

Sometimes, when you get too tired, you put on a negative filter on everything, especially the place you're gonna stay for next period.  

If that does not change your mind, be sure to have enough evidence.

Because, if you decide to complain to Airbnb, then there is no turning back. The host could be confrontational with you afterward.

&amp;#x200B;

**Establish The Type Of Problems You Dealing With**

Identify the problems and assess if these are fixable or not. 

For example, if the Airbnb has no house heating, then this problem seems to be fixable. The host can simply provide you with a portable heater. That is it, problem fixed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Document All The Faults**

Take a photo or video of all the problems on the property.

Also, check the Airbnb listing to see if the host mentions any of those things there. In other words, check if REALLY the Airbnb not as advertised.

If the host did not say anything in the listing, then you have solid grounds for the complaint. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Contacting The Host**

Keep in mind that, at this point, you should have already established if the problems are fixable or not.

* Fixable: Be as friendly as possible and kindly ask him to fix the problem. Show him the photos you took if necessary and point to the fact that his Airbnb listing did not mention any of those problems.
* Unfixable: This situation is a bit more complicated so I separated what to do into steps.

1. Again, start the conversation being nice, but tell the host the problem is not acceptable
2. Tell him that you do not want to stay in the property anymore, because of such problems. 
3. Ask the host to pay you back the full amount

**Getting Written Records**

If you were talking until now with the host by voice or face-to-face and he refused to solve the problem, even though you showed him the Airbnb is not as advertised, then what I would do next is to send him a message on the Airbnb platform.

&amp;#x200B;

**Contacting Airbnb Customer service**

Contact the Airbnb customer service using the Airbnb platform through their website or app.

Explain the problem to them and show photo evidence.

Also, point out that the problem was never made explicit in the Airbnb listing when you were booking.

But… what if Airbnb denies your refund, well, in that case, you have following three option:

1. Leave the property and lose the money
2. Call your credit card company and initiate a dispute
3. Accept the loss and stay in the property (this might include some minutes of crying in the shower on a fetal position as a side effect)

Beware, none of the outcome is good…

,AirBnB,"Hi, all. I mostly just want to vent and let people know about Airbnb's policies.

On 6/29, I booked a 2-night stay near Big Bend National Park for 7/8 to 7/10. We were really looking forward to the trip and getting out of the house. Then on 7/1, the Park Service announced they were closing the park due to a COVID-19 case, effective 7/2.

We decided there was no point in going if the park were closed, and cancelled the reservation.

However, when I cancelled I was given a refund of ""$0"" and, in fact, was charged $42 for a ""Price Adjustment"".... What is this!?

I am a homeowner living  in Austin , Texas hoping to place my whole home for rent on AirBnB. The house is about 10 to 15 minutes away from downtown, close to rail lines and about 7 minutes from an outdoor mall called The Domain  (which people seem to like)

,AirBnB,"Does Airbnb have a policy against deleting listings with bad reviews and then relisting them as new? Are we able to get any kind of refund?

My partner and I booked a place that didn't have any reviews at all, but the host had a little over 5,000 reviews from their other properties. In retrospect, we should have read those a little more closely, but I figured with that many bookings, they must be reliable. I can own that mistake. 

Anyway, before I even saw the reviews, it took me about 90 seconds in this place to wonder if we'd been deceived. First, there was the dirty bar soap on both the kitchen and bathroom sinks. I don't mean gently used soap either. I mean weird red splotches on it, dirt colored soap granules adhered to the top and some kind of weird black mold or mildew patches over the one in the kitchen. The bathroom floor wasn't wiped down, and there is what looks like a little drop of blood spatter near the toilet. Open and used travel bottles of shampoo in the shower...  Lots of little things, though if I took a picture of the place, you probably couldn't tell it was anything other than spotless.

In looking over the reviews,  I found one that seems to describe our booking down to the letter, including the specific ways in which the pictures of the sitting area and bathroom are different from the reality of the situation.

At the very least,  I was considering a request for our cleaning fee to be refunded. The place isn't even bad enough to outweigh my laziness and make me move to a new place on a two- night stay. But now that it seems more possible this person deceived us with a fake new listing, I feel mad about the situation and kind of want them to not be allowed to list on Airbnb until they address some of the issues that half their customers seem to be complaining about for every listing they have.

,AirBnB,"A user named Cameron is posting my house on Airbnb in a scam add using pictures that are taken from my house's old listing on Zillow.  For the second time a group of people knocked on my door last night after thinking they had rented my house.  We tried to contact the company after the first time this occurred but we could never get through, and we incorrectly assumed that after the renters reported the add and got their money back it would not be allowed to be posted again.

I don't think it's appropriate that to report the listing I had to create an Airbnb account last night.   You can't even contact their customer service without an account.  I tried to call their service hotline and they won't let me progress past the menu that wants my phone number so they can verify that I have an account.

This company is putting my family in danger by allowing this scam add to reappear.  The add was up again this morning, literally a single day after these people showed up at my house last night.  These people are getting scammed out of money and I am worried about what group of people is going to show up at my house next.  What should I do?  My wife tried to contact customer support last night through their chat feature and after a long wait the representative on the other end so that this wasn't their department and they would forward our info to the right department and we would hear back in 24 hours.  I want my home address banned from Airbnb so that the add cannot be put up again.  This user is also Verified! How can that be possible?  How is this user not being banned for obviously posting a fake add.

I am desperate to get someone from Airbnb to help me with this, and I am considering taking legal action to protect my family.  Does anyone have any ideas for how to get a representative on the phone?  I really need a direct line to customer support and I don't have the time to sit on hold for 2 hours at the moment (the wait last night was approximately 2 hours).  I can't believe that it is so hard to get in contact with this company.

&amp;#x200B;

Update Edit:  I thought I would give an update if anyone is interested.  Reported the ad when it appeared again yesterday morning, then we filed a police report.  The ad appeared again last night and we reported it again - this time stating that we would be taking legal action if they do not take it down for our safety.  Then, guess what, the ad appeared again this morning.  We have been told in both support chat and on the phone that our case is very important and has been transferred to the correct department and while on hold we had been disconnected / told that we would be contacted by the fraud department.   Nothing.  The last Airbnb employee I got on the phone told me that this was a ""very serious issue.""

For the second time a group of people knocked on my door last night after thinking they had rented my house.  We tried to contact the company after the first time this occurred but we could never get through, and we incorrectly assumed that after the renters reported the add and got their money back it would not be allowed to be posted again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s appropriate that to report the listing I had to create an Airbnb account last night.   You can&amp;#39;t even contact their customer service without an account.  I tried to call their service hotline and they won&amp;#39;t let me progress past the menu that wants my phone number so they can verify that I have an account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This company is putting my family in danger by allowing this scam add to reappear.  The add was up again this morning, literally a single day after these people showed up at my house last night.  These people are getting scammed out of money and I am worried about what group of people is going to show up at my house next.  What should I do?  My wife tried to contact customer support last night through their chat feature and after a long wait the representative on the other end so that this wasn&amp;#39;t their department and they would forward our info to the right department and we would hear back in 24 hours.  I want my home address banned from Airbnb so that the add cannot be put up again.  This user is also Verified! How can that be possible?  How is this user not being banned for obviously posting a fake add.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am desperate to get someone from Airbnb to help me with this, and I am considering taking legal action to protect my family.  Does anyone have any ideas for how to get a representative on the phone?  I really need a direct line to customer support and I don&amp;#39;t have the time to sit on hold for 2 hours at the moment (the wait last night was approximately 2 hours).  I can&amp;#39;t believe that it is so hard to get in contact with this company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update Edit:  I thought I would give an update if anyone is interested.  Reported the ad when it appeared again yesterday morning, then we filed a police report.
